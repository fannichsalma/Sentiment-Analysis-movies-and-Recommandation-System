Film,Commentaire
Project Almanac,"The teenager David Raskin (Jonny Weston) is a genius that dreams on joining the MIT. He has a crush on Jessie Pierce (Sofia Black-D'Elia) but he is too shy to date her. When David finds the design of a time machine that belonged to his father, he decides to build the device together with his friends Quinn Goldberg (Sam Lerner) and Adam Le (Allen Evangelista) and his sister Christina Raskin (Virginia Gardner). Soon Jessie joins the group and becomes David's girlfriend. When their experiment gets out of control and changing the future, David decides to fix the problems making them worse."
Project Almanac,"""Project Almanac"" is a sort of ""The Butterfly Effect 4"", with a similar storyline with many paradoxes. Each time that the teenagers interfere with the past for personal profit, the future changes and the responsible David tries to fix it. Unfortunately the funny adventure is ruined by the awful camera work. My vote is six."
Project Almanac,"Title (Brazil): ""Projeto Almanaque"" (""Project Almanac"")"
Project Almanac,"And this is true of both the characters in the movie and the viewer. Well the latter should rather try to enjoy as much as possible. Because the science behind it all does not really mix well together. A problem that the movie is not alone with. Mingling with time and trying to make it plausible is almost impossible. Just a few have managed to get the ""technical"" things right or rather the things right that would seem logical."
Project Almanac,"But throw logic out of the window, because this is about teenagers. And while you get the obvious ""what would you change, if you could"" discussion, in the end it all boils down to personal advantage (mostly). And can you blame them? The twist at the end is kind of redundant, but it's there and better than the alternate endings that can be watched on the disc/special features. Enjoyable if you don't think too much"
Project Almanac,"David Raskin (Jonny Weston) applies to MIT with the help of his friends Quinn Goldberg (Sam Lerner), Adam Le (Allen Evangelista), and his sister Christina Raskin (Virginia Gardner). He could only get a small partial scholarship and his mother is looking to sell their home to raise tuition money. While looking for his late father's experiments in the attic, David finds an old video of his 7th birthday but it has his older self in the video. He and his friends find parts of a time travel machine hidden in his basement. They reconstruct it and travel back in time with his crush Jessie Pierce (Sofia Black-D'Elia)."
Project Almanac,"This uses the found footage idea and the shaky cam moves get tiresome. It adds nothing and has no real internal logic. The kids are all excited and hyper. Obviously, it's intended to inject energy into the movie. That also gets tiresome. The big turning point is Lollapalooza which only adds to the superficiality of the whole enterprise. The premise starts out well but the movie is a long slow downward slide. Its initial potential slowly fades away."
Project Almanac,"So the films starts off establishing that they are all smart, and the sister likes to film. The whole film is done in the found footage format."
Project Almanac,"The story is actually interesting when you break it down. The whole ground hog moment, was to establish the beginning of the ripple effect. Every time Quinn entered the Chemistry room, he showed cockiness and preparations, which led the teacher to throw curve ball questions. and until Quinn knew the answers to all of the possible questions he had to keep on repeating it."
Project Almanac,"The lottery ticket. ""Why didn't they go back and rewrite it"" as Adam said he didn't want to waste his time worrying that some how they cheated and being in that panic mode. Remember how nervous their were filling in the paper and get away from the store after. Plus this was, plus don't forget this is still all experiments for them. They can go back and win more lotteries any time they wanted to."
Project Almanac,"David kept on pushing the machines ability to travel further by using the time watchers. Remember in the begging he said that they can only go back as far as 3 weeks, but later he said it can be possible to go back up to 10 years. Next step was 3 month: Lollapalooza. we did hear his sister say that she missed out."
Project Almanac,"This is where it starts to get more complicated and can be taken in two theories. After the failed kiss David goes back to Lollapalooza and if we see carefully he is walking at fast paced and his friends say ""Oh there he is."" ""Looks like he is actually gonna do it"" So we can assume that there was a period of time in which the first time David was away trying to get the courage to approach her, and the second David timed it so that he would take her on this walk before he managed to get there. Still don't get it? Think of Back to the future when Marty goes back for the second time and has to make sure he doesn't run into himself in the past."
Project Almanac,"David going all the way back to his 7th birthday after Jessie's disappearing. We saw Quinn nearly disappear when he started to look at himself, but the guys quickly moved him away from his sight. They broke the circle of both consciousness trying to comprehend what was happening. Unfortunately for Jessie, David didn't do that and let the circle complete erasing her at the present time line. So if he was to go back another day, she would still exist in that period. But not from Tuesday 7pm or whatever it was."
Project Almanac,"David destroying the machine in the end is paradox. No its not, and here is why in the first video of him being seen in the mirror. His father is lighting up the candles, when he goes back in the end, his father is talking to his mother. In the first Video when they figure out that the keys belong to Jessie and re watch the video, there is no blood on his hand, when he is there in the end, the blood is clearly visible. Him trying to save his father the first time, theory. His father clearly states ""You figured it... i have so many questions"" Obviously his father knew that he wasn't going to figure it out. and most importantly why was he hiding it after the mysterious phone call? he knew that he was going to die, probably for not handing over the machine to the government. ""Why you ask?' well because David in the end says ""its time for you to say goodbye to your son"" and the father's line to the young version of David ""A friend, he is here to fix something"" My assumption on this, is that his father knew the risks with the machine, and was hoping to either have more to study it or die protecting its secret. After seeing his son, he clearly understood what he was there to do."
Project Almanac,"So why was David in the first video originally, Because the movie we were watching was not the prime time line, but rather already altered time line where David wanted to speak to his father in hopes of figuring out what can be done to try and change the future. Second time line David came back a few moments later. Remember him stopping at the door for few seconds? No? re watch it. David would not have been caught in the Party camera the second time. Through the clips when David was watching all of the party moments, The camera captured the moment when his father was talking to the mother about the call and was in a different angle, so he erased any evidence of himself at that party from that camera. He burnt all of the notes and destroyed the machine as he did that we see that he starts to flicker. That happens, because destroying the machine means you destroy the one that is in your backpack, and if the one in your back pack never existed then you never came here. The camera CAN BE (ad argued for a plot hole but) explained as just a object, which could not alter the universe (Like leaving a stick behind) Camera doesn't have any living organisms or bacteria. The end is them seeing the second camera and discovering that they learned how to time travel, and seeing presumable everything that we saw in the film. So when he walks up to Jessie at the end, he already seen it and knew what she was going to say. But they no longer can time travel, as the machine or the blue prints don't exist"
Project Almanac,Hope you guys liked my review! and any questions feel free to send me a message.
Project Almanac,This film seems to have really divided people on here but on the whole I really liked it.
Project Almanac,"Teenager David Raskin (A very good Jonny Weston, an actor clearly with a good career ahead of him) is a bit of a brain box at school. His best friend is an even bigger nerd than he is and not as brainy and of course he fancies one of the it girls, while his sister is being bullied by some others. Weston is a very good looking actor, so trying to pass him off as a science geek is really a bit of a stretch one of the films weakest flaws but one I was prepared to forgive. This group form an unlikely alliance when they discover via one of David's deceased Dad's experiments, they have invented time travel. They jump together and change various things in their recent past and also do some fairly typical teenage things like go and win the lottery. Someone on here was moaning saying people wouldn't do that, they would go back and see people they loved and so on - well I am fairly certain as a teenager I would do both."
Project Almanac,Our lead character though cannot leave well enough alone and jumps once too often and the ripple effect begins to cause them problems.
Project Almanac,"Project Almanac is a found footage film and these normally alone will cause me not to watch them but I found the premise of this one intriguing enough to seek it out. It's helped by a reasonably good script which plays out like a good episode of the Twilight Zone but what really helps the film is the cast. Its pretty rare that a group of teenage actors should all be universally so good, but that is certainly the case here. Sofia Black-D'Elia who more recently starred in Born of War is especially good and one I predict big things for while Sam Lerner who plays the thankless role of the Annoying friend clearly has taken on board everything his actor father taught him. This really is a talented group of individuals."
Project Almanac,"The film reminded me of the 1980s cult film The Explorers and I found myself rooting for the hero towards the end because you wanted him to set everything right. I really enjoyed this film and stayed up really late when I was super tired to watch it. Thankfully I wasn't bored and I was with them until the end. Recommended, from me at least anyway."
Project Almanac,"Project Almanac is a found footage time travel movie. And as far as time travel films go this must be one of the worst I've ever seen. It takes them almost half of the movie to make the damn thing (with old car batteries and Xbox 360 parts) and once they have the power to travel through time, what do they do? Go to parties and concerts coz apparently they were to stupid to go to them like in normal time. The movie also does little effort to respect some time travel rules like concerning duplicates off yourself already being there at the same place etc. Spoiler: they redo a certain part like 8 times (groundhog style like the characters correctly state) to do...a chemistry test over and over. WTF??? Then they get the fantastic idea to play the lottery, they f*ck it up by only filling in 5 of the 6 numbers correctly so they only win 1,8 m$ instead of 53m$, and THAT they only do once??? I have to say I've never seen a time travel flick where the characters and the retarded plot enraged me so much as this one. I know the target audience is teenagers but even they must have seen better in this genre. The directors next movie is going to be 'Power Rangers'. I'm wondering if he was so stupid to choose that himself or if the studio execs wanted to punish him for making dumb movies."
Project Almanac,"I liked Project Almanac. It didn't necessarily excite me. And I did scratch my head a few times. But ultimately, I liked it. It had an interesting, if slow moving, story. It stayed grounded, or at least tried to, and did it's very best to legitimize time travel as a possibility, even if it doesn't do a very good job of actually explaining the whole thing. Certainly some things are silly, like explaining being able to control the time machine with a cell phone as cell phones 'having enough power to put a rocket in space', but these don't really take away from a lot of the fun dealing with the time travel element."
Project Almanac,"The story is pretty simple, but actually feels heart felt. David, a genius level teenager newly accepted to MIT, finds himself short on the money to pay his tuition there. This inadvertently leads him to discover an unfinished time machine his absent father left hidden in his basement. While it takes a while for the time travel elements to ramp up, there is fun to be had in seeing these kids build, experiment, and ultimately successfully travel through time. The film does a good job in allowing us to escape certain illogical elements, like how a group of teens with a fairly limited budget could create a fully functioning time machine, much less create one when no one else on earth seemingly could. David and his buddy Adam are already established as being geniuses from the moment the film begins. So, it's not much of a leap that together they could figure out how to complete the already crafted instructions and blueprints sitting in front of them. You could even say there's legitimacy to the use of the found footage style they went for. They even comment on the use of the camera, which at least shows they recognize that it's there."
Project Almanac,"However, despite some explanation that helps solidify the camera's constant presence, the film , like so many found footage films, would have benefited from simply being shot like a typical narrative. The film even goes the lengths to, strangely enough, be somewhere in between. We see edits that don't make sense for someone whose recording and we have music play over things like a montage. It's just bizarre to see and hear these things play out over a film that is supposed to pretend to be found off camcorder footage. And these production elements aren't bad, they're just out of place and show the film could have benefited from simply eschewing the found footage style all together. There's also some head scratching moments throughout that can be eye-roll-inducing, but I tend to be able to suspend my disbelief, so it didn't bother me as much."
Project Almanac,"The film overall isn't one I'd probably tell people to run out and see. But I'd certainly tell them it's not a bad film. Far from it, it's a surprise in the sub genre of found footage. And while it doesn't reach the heights of Chronicle, which I consider to be the peak of found footage, I do think it's one of the better found footage films."
Project Almanac,"I just finished watching Project Almanac and if you haven't seen it yet, you might want to check it out. I was pleasantly surprised being that I had low hopes going in. it's another found footage movie, so if you are sick of them you might not enjoy it very much. Also if you're already not into time travel or science in general you might leave the theater with a bad taste in your mouth. I ended up enjoying it quite a bit and if I had to compare it to another movie I would say it has a strong feel of Project X and Chronical mixed together with the bases of it being more scientific then social(Project X) or supernatural(Chronical). You'll spend more time than usual feeling happy for the characters as they're having fun rather than the usual dose of drama every five minutes to keep people chewing their finger nails wondering what's going to happen next if Marie finds out Tony was talking to Marisa behind the bleaches and all that teen nonsense. it had a few mistakes but it's a movie so get over it. If I had to say one bad thing about it, I couldn't. I love science, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and for me it was an easy line drive down the middle of the plate knocked right out of the park. Personally I would give it a solid 8 out of 10 but if you're not a science buff you might be looking more at a 6-6.5 out of 10."
Project Almanac,"Just watched this last night, and I have to say it is one of the worst time travel films I have seen. For starters, the writing is a joke, the whole plot is weak and lacks any logic or intelligence for a movie based on science!! It is not smart and is filled with stupid plot holes that are quite insulting to us movie lovers. A lazy work of writing here."
Project Almanac,The acting does not add anything special from a group of teen wanna bes. The shaky camera angle was also boring and distracting to say the least.
Project Almanac,"It actually started out well and showed potential as it created interest as the characters struggled to create the time machine, but once they succeeded, the film just felt flat and did not have any direction or goal and it lost its intrigue."
Project Almanac,"Save yourself the time and money and skip this lazy attempt of time travel film making, if anything, it did not learn anything from previous films of the same genre"
Project Almanac,"Much like Chronicle, this film profiles exactly what would happen when you give teenagers certain powers. In Chronicle it was ""super powers"" in Project Almanac, it's the ability to travel through time. There were elements of this film that made me give it far more credit than I would normally have."
Project Almanac,"1.) Seeing Yourself - This is the first time travel movie that I've seen where in the instance of someone seeing there physical self in the past can cause a fault in time where both individuals disappear, like they cancel each other out or something."
Project Almanac,"2.) Time Travel and Power - Unlike most time travel movies where the possibilities seem limitless with the machine, the one in Project Almanac requires mass amounts of power to be able to work. Not unlike the DeLorean in Back to the Future. However in Project Almanac, they can't instantly travel back in time 1,000 years. In fact the furthest they are ever able to go back is 10 years. That's what really made me appreciate this film the most I think. That even time travel has its limits, and even when they work out the algorithms, they can only go back so far, successfully."
Project Almanac,"3.) Full Circle - I loved how they brought everything full circle at the end of the film. I was quite happy with how they ended it, I had so many questions, but that's what made it so much fun. Not every single thing needs to be answered, some things can be left for the viewer to figure out."
Project Almanac,"4.) The Budget - One thing you have to remember going into this movie is that it's not a $75 million film, it's a film with a modest to low budget. Given what they had to work with, I was thoroughly impressed with most of the visuals during the time traveling scenes, not bad at all."
Project Almanac,"You create time travel and you use it to go to concerts and parties? How moronic.
This movie had a lot of potential but it devolved into a bunch of stupid acts by some kids who were too smart for their own good."
Project Almanac,"It seems the ""found footage"" film genre is in no danger of dying out any time soon. This one at least tries to mix in another genre that has proved popular over the years, the time travel genre. Not only that, but it also makes the main characters teenagers. Naturally, with the movie covering more than one angle, the results are interesting at times. The screenplay does try to make the movie more intelligent and logical than usual - for example, the movie takes its time by showing the teens (realistically) making multiple tests on the time travel machine before trying it on themselves. And when they do start trying it on themselves, the actions they do one by one do seem believable."
Project Almanac,"Unfortunately, while I did appreciate (at first) this slow and methodical treatment, ultimately it backfired. The movie eventually becomes too long and too slow; it takes more than three quarters of the running time before the central characters find themselves in trouble. Curiously, while the movie is too long, there are some plot points that are never explained, like why all of a sudden the police are pursing the main character."
Project Almanac,"The movie probably would have worked better if it had taken a page from the 2012 found footage ""Chronicle"" - that movie had a good balance between showing enough planning and detail by the teens who find great power while bringing in conflict much earlier. (And the movie was twenty minutes shorter.) As it is, ""Project Almanac"" does have some interest and intelligence, but I think many viewers will soon become impatient with it."
Project Almanac,"'Project Almanac' has all the hallmarks of a Michael Bay production; stolen ideas, annoying characters, an excessive runtime, bad directing and shameless product placement. Many of these factors can be attributed to another produced Bay film which came out in 2014, 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'. I will be fair to this film; the trailer intrigued me enough to want to seek this one out in the cinema. Until I saw text that read 'from producer Michael Bay' then I shuddered in horror, I had signed myself up for an appalling experience in every sense of the word."
Project Almanac,"Do you remember when found footage became its own genre in 1999 with the tense, scary and nerve wracking experience in horror which was 'The Blair Witch Project'? Then it became stretched to breaking point with the atrocious 'Paranormal Activity' series which matches only how tedious it is by its laugh ability. 'Project Almanac' tests the same limits with science fiction replacing horror. I hope with all my heart that this trend stops and soon."
Project Almanac,"In 'Project Almanac' we follow several teenagers, one of which locates his dead father's secret; a time machine. Groovy! Well no it is anything but. Let me elaborate. It was an original idea in 1985's 'Back to the Future', heck it even worked for 2012's 'Looper', but alas not here. There are many different reasons why and that is because the concept itself feels tired and dated. It tries to unforgivably and to its own error rip off plot points from last year's 'Edge of Tomorrow' but to no avail; like having to relive a day or event again and again. But most mind numbingly of all, it copies the exact same ending, only with a slight variation upon it. No doubt hoping audiences will not notice. I am sure that most will."
Project Almanac,"The key problem with 'Project Almanac' is its story. Now this would not present as much of a problem if it had somewhere interesting to go. The trouble is that when the group of dumb, sexist and annoying teenagers use it, they only do so for the most pointless and uninteresting ideas that have been done to the death already; such as winning the lottery, trying to win a girl's affections or just getting smashed like everyone else their age. It is only in the last ten minutes that they realise the full potential of the time travelling device and anything noteworthy actually takes place. They save lives. But this is not enough. It is almost like the film itself is asking you to walk straight out of the door. It references 'Star Wars' and 'The Terminator' series among others. Why bother with this film when you can watch any of these classics rather than this repugnant film that gets passed off as film making. Words fail me to express my boredom with sufficient and appropriate detail. Nothing happens; literally nothing. Another key element to bring up now is that the camera footage is edited throughout each scene, the dialogue is clear and the focus is alarmingly accurate! I'm not too sure that this was filmed on a cheap video camera. But this is a minor flaw in a film filled to the brim with them."
Project Almanac,"The acting is poor and painful to watch. The lead actor just lurches from scene to scene with no real purpose or intent. He just looks lost. At least the lead actress is passable. But we should not have to put up with this level of amateurish acting, it is sad that this is what Hollywood has devolved into. The film refuses to end and seems to ask itself the question; is there any point in this being filmed? Well to pad out the runtime for one. It is unbearable and never ending at just over 100 minutes in length."
Project Almanac,Perhaps one of the worst offenders in this film is its product placement that makes no sense in the slightest. The products are always facing directly towards the camera. What is most annoying though is one particular shot that slows down time just so the audience can catch a glimpse of a red bull can. This is soulless filmmaking with no purpose other than to steal your hard earned cash. It even has a chance to bring up social media. Because that's what the director has been told that teenagers like and have an interest in.
Project Almanac,"Obviously this is a found footage film. So there is going to be shaky camera present in the film. However, it is shot to levels where you cannot tell what on earth is going on. I truly wanted this film to end. There is no point to any of it all."
Project Almanac,"'Project Almanac' joins the ranks of vile found footage films like 'Paranormal Activity'; featuring no character development, a lack of an interesting plot and a plodding run time that will test the patience of even the most devoted film goer. Devoid of art, heart, meaning, soul or a point, 'Project Almanac' is a cynical exercise with only two things in its limited mind; to waste your time and money. My only wish is to go back in time to forget my experience of 'Project Almanac'."
Project Almanac,"5 annoying students find out how to build a time machine with some car batteries and an Xbox....during the first test, a toy car ends up welded into a wall. They decide to try it on themselves...just as they're about to ""jump"" the leader warns them they might explode. They do it anyway, and use time travel to get better answers on their tests, and to get girls, win the lottery,humiliate the school bully, and get back stage passes to an Imagine Dragons gig. Someone they know dies on a random plane crash, so the leader goes back in time to say hi to his dad, who died 10 years previously, and destroys the time machine.It ends abruptly. The audience walk away, wishing they also had a time machine so they could go back and stop everyone involved in the making of this nonsense."
Project Almanac,"A part of me likes some of these 'found footage' films though they can be a bit hit or miss. However they have certainly come a long way since the days of the Blair Witch Project (which I really didn't like all that much). Some of them, such as Chronicle, can be quite disturbing, but one thing that I must say is that they can be very difficult to do well, and Project Almanac is certainly one that has been done really, really well (though it is certainly not one of those low budget films that appear every so often, such as Paranormal Activity)."
Project Almanac,"So, the story is about an engineering genius who is trying to get into university and while he comes up with an impressive project, the university decide that it is not good enough for a full scholarship, so rather than have his mother sell the house, he goes searching through the attic to see if there is anything that his Dad left behind that he could work on – which is when they discover a camera containing footage that shows his contemporary self in the mirror at his 7th Birthday party. Attempting to uncover the mystery they stumble upon his father's plans for a time machine."
Project Almanac,"The idea about this film is that you cannot go back in time without changing the present. In a way that is a no brainer. However it is interesting how a lot of these movies suggest that when the past is changed we in effect 'lose' memory, that is that while we may have changed something we do not see the events that occur between when we changed the past and the point in time to which we return. In many cases we are blind to the true effects of what we have done. It is also interesting to suggest that such interference is addictive. When David realises that he has made a mistake, he goes back in time, for purely selfish reasons, to change that mistake. However that one change results in other changes and in the end he finds himself trying a plug a dyke that is leaking from many areas with only one hand."
Project Almanac,"Look, as with every time travel movie, there are inconsistencies – that is always going to happen. Firstly time travel is very speculative so we really do not know what meddling in the past would do if we could do it. Also, in many cases, the plot is king, meaning that we have to suspend out disbelief and ignore the inconsistencies if we are going to have a movie that works. This is why you have them go back multiple times to get one of the guys to pass his chemistry exam without running into the others."
Project Almanac,"I also felt that the movie did end quite well, and does leave that big question in the air. However I won't go into too many details here because I don't want to spoil the movie too much. I guess, in the end, it is still a 'found footage' movie, and while the plot was great, I do realise that a lot of people suffer from motion sickness in these films."
Project Almanac,"Time travel is always a tricky subject for a filmmaker to tackle. It's been done countless times, with countless interpretations, and most attempts struggle to show us anything we haven't seen before. But every once in awhile, someone comes along with an idea that breathes new life into the genre, and aside from a few stumbles in the third act, Project Almanac fits nicely into that category."
Project Almanac,"Teenage genius David Raskin (Jonny Weston) just got accepted to MIT, but there's one problem - he was only awarded a partial scholarship, and his mother's only solution to afford the staggering tuition cost is to put the family home on the market. Hoping to apply for a last- minute grant from a yearly technology competition, David begins digging through his late father's possessions for potential ideas, and discovers an old video camera containing footage from his seventh birthday party. But as he reviews the tape with his sister, he makes a startling discovery - his modern-day self is visible in the background of the footage."
Project Almanac,"Along with his closest friends and fellow inventors Adam (Allen Evangelista) and Quinn (Sam Lerner), David begins tearing through his father's basement workshop looking for answers. He finds them hidden in a floor safe: a small device, along with a collection of notebooks and blueprints for a ""temporal displacement"" device. ""We can't build a time machine in my basement,"" David says in disbelief, before Adam reminds him of the video footage. ""I think we already did."""
Project Almanac,"The experimentation process quickly becomes the highlight of Project Almanac, as David and his friends repeatedly test the device on various objects. The visuals here are tremendous fun, and the sheer, unadulterated joy the kids display when they realize what they've accomplished is infectious. They behave exactly the way you would expect teenagers with a time machine would behave: they go back in time to ace tests, stand up to bullying classmates, attend Lollapalooza, and in David's case, win the affections of longtime crush Jessie Pierce (Sofia Black-D'Elia)."
Project Almanac,"The film runs into trouble around the beginning of the third act, when a seemingly innocuous deed turns out to have severe ramifications for the rest of the world. There's no clear explanation why things have become so dour, when previous trips into the past didn't result in disaster, and the film quickly descends into Butterfly Effect territory as each attempt to correct these mistakes results in further calamity. The ending also provides far more questions than answers, which is particularly disappointing when the first two-thirds of the film is so well-done."
Project Almanac,"Project Almanac also loses a few points thanks to a found footage approach that does more harm than good. The hand-held camera makes perfect sense as the kids film their experiments - David is a scientist, after all, and scientists like to document everything. But a lot of the dialogue-only scenes would have been better served by a more traditional cinematography style, as there are plenty of scenes where constantly holding onto a camcorder doesn't seem plausible."
Project Almanac,"These are minor issues, to be sure, but they're still issues that keep Project Almanac from being a truly great film. As it stands, it's still a thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable entry into the genre - just make sure you take some Dramamine beforehand, and don't try too hard to make sense of the overlapping timelines in the third act, or the film's head-scratching conclusion."
Project Almanac,"This was a good movie with a good concept and an interesting point of view. It was shot ""differently""-from like a hand-held camera point of view, which I think helped the atmosphere, and I also liked the references to other time travel movies like Timecop, Bill & Ted, and Looper. After spotting himself in present form in a reflection in an old video, a teenaged kid realizes his father has left him instructions on how to build a time machine, and he and his friends proceed to build one, and agree to terms like never ""leap"" alone and record their leaps. They initially use it for their own gains like passing classes and winning the lottery. However, future leaps later have disastrous consequences! If you are into time travel films, you will love this one. It has humor, action, and great lines. I liked it."
Project Almanac,*** out of ****
Project Almanac,I'm not going to include any spoilers. I enjoyed the story and found the cast appealing. It was an interesting idea with some good special effects. There were a couple of plot holes but there were also some funny nods to movies such as Back to the Future which I enjoyed. You remember the scene where Doc Brown is trying to get two electric cables to connect?
Project Almanac,"It reminded me a lot of the superb low-budget 'Primer' which covers some of the same ground. In that movie, some geekie guys accidentally discover time-travel and have to decide what to do with it. Also, Almanac had some good jokes, which many movies seem to leave out."
Project Almanac,"Seriously, did you see any jokes in Man of Steel? Sadly the shocking camera work ruined the whole experience.All the jumping about, whirling, juddering and flicking etc. It just made me feel ill."
Project Almanac,After seeing the trailer to this film I thought what a fantastic idea and great story this would be. The potential for greatness was evident.
Project Almanac,"Sadly, the film failed to live up to what it could have been: A great thriller and sci-fi classic."
Project Almanac,"The ""shaky cam"" style of the film was overdone and nauseating at times. I feel that the story could have been far better served by shooting it traditionally or at least limiting the use of the ""shaky cam."" The story has far too many plot holes and flaws and contradictions to be believable or even enjoyable. Again, such a wasted potential. It could have been so much more."
Project Almanac,"For instance, the main characters express that the reason they built the time machine was not about the money yet one of the first things they do is go back in time to win the Lottery. They could have sold the technology to a global ""Microsoft"" type corporation and become billionaires and helped to further the advancement of mankind however this group decides to use the time machine for their own selfish and ultimately stupid ends."
Project Almanac,"I ask you, if you had a time machine at your disposal, what would you use it to do or change? avert disasters? save lives? See your loved ones again? The protagonists in this film use it to:pass an exam, pick up girls, stand up to a bully and go to a concert. All things that they could have done without a time machine."
Project Almanac,"And speaking of the main characters, again they are badly written and flawed. Right from the start they are portrayed as a group of bumbling fools that mess up at every turn. It is really hard to believe that these clowns had the brains to build a time machine."
Project Almanac,"As an example, with all the knowledge of the future at their disposal they still manage to Not win the Lottery through sheer ineptness. It also takes them about 5 attempts to pass that chemistry exam, having to travel back in time multiple times. Certainly not the bright minds that you would expect to create such a revolutionary invention (even if the plans were already there for them)."
Project Almanac,"I could go on and on about the numerous flaws and mistakes that make no sense at all, and believe me the list is exhaustive. But instead I will just say what a disappointment this film was. The potential for greatness was there and yet it was squandered hopelessly through bad writing, poor camera work and nonsensical plot-holes and poor character development."
Project Almanac,I could not recommend this movie to anyone. What a waste...
Project Almanac,Just returned home from seeing this awful movie. Please don't waste your $$$. It's like watching a non-cartoon version of Scooby Doo but without the humor. Shaky camera to make up for the stupid plot that doesn't have a coherent story line.
Project Almanac,"Did you know if you have a can of hydrogen and a smart phone you can time travel? Yeah, me either. Bad, bad, bad. I sat through the whole movie and gave my full attention the whole time and I can't tell you any of the characters names. It's like Paranormal Activity on steroids but without a cohesive plot. Just avoid and don't even waste your time when it comes out to rent. You will be better off watching paint dry."
Project Almanac,If you like to watch very annoying kids AND like really horrible camera work this is your movie. If not: dont spend a minute on it.
Project Almanac,This movie is a tough nut to crack. Honestly I do not understand the artistic choice in cinematography AT ALL. This has to be the worst found footage film ever made.
Project Almanac,"When you look apart from that, why is it that American teens are made out to be hysterical hyper idiots even when the story line tries to pass them off as potential MIT students? The general behaviour and choices made takes a lot away from the plot or story line of the movie and simply makes it that much harder to accept the concept."
Project Almanac,"In the end this movie feels like a dumbed down version of Butterfly Effect, but maybe that's what this generation of teens need? Something hype and simple to soothe their unimaginative minds."
Project Almanac,Major thumbs down...
Project Almanac,"I am an engineer, I do the sort of things these guys ""do"". The first 5 minutes into this movie I knew it was going to be so ffing idiotic. ""the phone call is interrupting the wifi"".....someone please punch the writer in the face. Phone calls and wifi are on completely separate frequencies. Yet this guy is supposedly going to operate a time machine with that level of knowledge. MIT would think this was a joke video. It actually pains me to watch this show of idiocy"
Project Almanac,"This is the kind of movie that caters to the technologically retarded who go ""ooooh shiny"". I mean the guy literally just spouts jargon that has nothing to do with anything. ""Hey how do i fix this?"" ""Oh you put the flux capacitor in the defibrillator and press the hypotenuse button"""
Project Almanac,"""we are going to take it to its max altitude"" ""its not responding"".. smash smash smash on the keyboard keys, yeah because that's going to work..."
Project Almanac,"So to sum it up, if you know anything about technology this movie is unwatchable because everything is wrong, even the stuff in real life that everyone has is being used and explained as if my 90 year old technophobe grandmother had just skimmed a manual on particle physics."
Project Almanac,This movie should be in the genre cringe comedy.
Project Almanac,"You know what I'd do if I had a time machine dear reader? I'd travel back a few hours ago and make sure my past-self had a beer during my viewing of this film. Not that it's necessarily an unbearable movie, but I can almost guarantee it would at least have made the viewing slightly more whimsical and carefree."
Project Almanac,"Admittedly I did enjoy this film, despite its tired and uninspired use of the found-footage gimmick and the teen vibe that saturates every scene in this film. It's not wildly inventive with how it tackles the sub-genre of time-travel, but there are a few glimmers of originality in an already derivative heavy lineage and visually some of the effects are pretty neat. More time-travel movies need to have that explosive mode of teleportation like you'd get in the Terminator films."
Project Almanac,"David Raskin is your typical MIT hopeful/wunderkind that needs to demonstrate aptitude in order to attain financial aid. After stumbling upon a half-invented time-machine his deceased father had been working on, David and his friends begin a slightly comical experimentation process to construct the device. Eventually they progress to actually traveling back in time up to several months past and enjoy rewriting history to their benefit."
Project Almanac,"They fix the lottery, they help one of the group ace his chemistry presentation, the sister gets revenge on some Mean Girls that were bullying her, and ultimately David and resident hot girl Jessie begin to fall in love. I'll spare you the spoilers, but if you've ever seen another serious time-travel film like Primer, Looper, Time Lapse etc. you already know that 'temporal relocation' is always fraught with consequence. Eventually ripple effects become apparent and David is tasked with fixing the damage they've all done."
Project Almanac,"All in all I wasn't disappointed in my choice to see this, but it's probably not something I'd recommend paying the $10 for. The found- footage aspect is incredibly detracting as the camera is seemingly omnipotent throughout the film - despite its purpose being to 'record everything for scientific discovery' (implying someone ought to be filming). They really should have just stuck with traditional storytelling or at the very least limited the GoPro style filming to only the time journeys."
Project Almanac,"Take some advice from the movie Looper and don't get caught up in all the intricacies of time-travel or the obvious plot-holes in this film and you'll be fine. Otherwise you'll fry your brain wondering 'Why didn't they do ____' . Treat it as a bit of self-indulged fun and maybe have a beer or two and you'll get some entertainment out of this film. It has a low budget, a minuscule investment in things like character development or being a coherent narrative, and probably will fall into obscurity before long."
Project Almanac,Read this and other reviews on the DriveInZeppelin website
Project Almanac,"Project Almanac is a sci-fi found footage film about.... no, not horror.... time travel. I thought it was an interesting way to show a time travel film and really made sense when you were watching it, as to why they would be filming, so it helped to know why they always had a camera out. Overall i would have to say that this was a pretty fun film and doesn't go too over the top with the confusing back and forth through time stuff that other time travel films do. It is pretty easy to understand for a general audience and that helps to have more people follow the plot but can make it a little more predictable. I didn't feel that this was all that predictable though, there were quite a few moments that i could not have guessed and some others that were foreshadowed a little too much. So in terms of the plot it was very coherent for 96% of the film and i have to say was also interesting, just the last 2 minutes of the film for me got unnecessarily complex and ruined the fun adventure the rest of the film felt like."
Project Almanac,"Also, while this was a found footage film there were many times throughout the film where i was able to forget about that. The shaky cam and awkward camera angles that do bother me in other found footage films didn't have the same effect in this film. Some of the ways that sections are shot with a mounted camera or in an environment that would be shot with a moving camera in a regular film helped to take my mind off the fact that this was just another found footage film. So to make it a found footage film but have elements of just a regularly shot sci-fi film i thought really elevated the film."
Project Almanac,"In terms of the characters i thought they were all very well written, sometimes a little over exaggerated in terms of their emotions but as a group i thought they worked pretty well. I also have no idea who these actors were but they were all pretty good, no standouts but they were all good to watch. Unfortunately where this film let me down a little was the first section of the film before all of the funky time travel stuff begins, it was just a little too slow and i would have liked for them to just cut to the chase and get to the time travelling without the setup that didn't really add anything to the film except for a few minor plot points later in the film. In the end this sci-fi time travel film does a good job at creating a fun and easily understandable story with pretty good characters. But is let down by a fairly unnecessary first section and a very unnecessarily confusing ending. - 7.3"
Kill Me Three Times,"Good cast, good story and nice landscapes. There is plenty of humor involved in this film and I enjoyed references in typical characters which you encounter in these style of crime-hitman-comedy movies. I don't think this movie is trying to take itself serious and that is a good thing. The story overall is interesting but nothing new, except for a nice run of continuous twists. Don't get discouraged by the low ratings; this is a fun Aussie film with Simon Pegg delivering once again. 7/10"
Kill Me Three Times,'KILL ME THREE TIMES': Three Stars (Out of Five)
Kill Me Three Times,"A black comedy crime-thriller, starring Simon Pegg; as a hit-man hired to kill a businessman's cheating wife. The film was directed by Kriv Stenders and written by first-time feature film writer James McFarland. It costars Alice Braga, Sullivan Stapleton, Teresa Palmer, Luke Hemsworth, Callan Mulvey and Bryan Brown. The movie is surprisingly dark and brutally violent; but it's not as funny, or as shocking, as it wants to be."
Kill Me Three Times,"Pegg plays Charlie Wolfe; an assassin for hire, and private investigator, working in Western Australia. When a successful motel and bar owner, Jack Taylor (Mulvey), suspects his wife, Alice (Braga), of cheating on him; he hires Wolfe to find out. After Charlie brings back info, that's not to Jack's liking, Jack hires him to kill Alice. While Charlie is attempting to complete the assignment, he finds out that another couple (Stapleton and Palmer) wants her dead as well. Things get complicated, and the story is told from three different points of view."
Kill Me Three Times,"Pegg is fantastic as the movie's main villain; and it's nice to see him playing against type for-a-change. The supporting cast is all adequate as well, and the directing is decent. The script is somewhat clever, and it also has a few nice twists, but it's nothing too memorable. The film is entertaining enough, while you're watching it, but it doesn't offer much more than that."
Kill Me Three Times,Watch out movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaTQgKVh7fQ
Kill Me Three Times,"""What your talking about is a one way street. Once you start there is no going back."" Charlie Wolfe (Pegg) is a professional hit man that has just been given a job to kill the wife of a client. What he thinks will be an easy job soon becomes harder when he realizes he isn't the only one trying to kill her. This movie had flashes, and reminded me a little of Pulp Fiction. The way the movie skipped around and you got more backstory with each successive scene, while the movie is moving forward at the same time. This is not the typical Simon Pegg role, but he was a good choice for this. The movie took a generic hit-man idea and really did something with it to make it feel new and exciting. This is nothing all that amazing, but it is a really fun movie to watch and a good way to spend an hour and a half without having to think too hard. Overall, exciting and entertaining. A fun rental that is worth seeing. I give this a B."
Kill Me Three Times,"With it's upbeat music and sunny weather KMTT is much darker than it seems at first sight. More Fargo than anything else, it is a 'comedy of errors' - if murder can be funny. The cast delivers well, though Simon Pegg as the bad guy is better than most with his laconic and slightly creepy character. The plot and pacing are competent, as are the photography and editing. Still, somehow, KMTT can't quite seem to make up its mind whether to be humorous or serious; there are actually a couple of rather nasty bits that are delivered in an off-hand way. Fairly predictable, but all the same the way it is done is tidy enough. It's worth watching for some light entertainment, just don't expect to remember it the next week."
Kill Me Three Times,"This is a alright rental, it's not a really good rental but it's decent enough. It's not as terrible as some critics claim it to be. Sure it's not all that original for that twist and turn and every connects near the end type of movie. But it's decent enough for it to make it worth a watch. Despite me hating all of the characters in this movie. So the plot is about a hit-man named Charlie Wolfe played by Simon Pegg getting entangled or intentionally gets into a mess. Simon Pegg's role in this is basically tailing other characters, spying on them then snarling and chuckling in a creepy awkward manner every time he sees something bizarre. The director of this movie seems to have been really inspired by Pulp Fiction, but the whole thing just doesn't mesh together all that well. And the characters and dialogues is more annoying than interesting. But it was a watchable flick and despite it not having a immensely immersive story it was a okay effort. Lastly I thought it was cool how Sullivan Stapleton could play such a badass in ""300: Rise of an Empire"" and such a weak cowardly loser in this. Simon Pegg playing the lead role as a hit-man and Sullivan Stapleton playing the somewhat villain I thought this would be a good movie, but it's decent at best."
Kill Me Three Times,6/10
Kill Me Three Times,"Despite being a Simon Pegg film, I wouldn't call this one a comedy exactly. While there are some darkly funny elements, this isn't really a funny film--in fact, it's very violent and bloody. Now this is not a complaint--it's actually a very good film and is well worth seeing."
Kill Me Three Times,"When the film begins, you are a bit confused. Once you realize that the film is NOT shown in sequence, it all begins to make more sense. It seems that an assassin (Pegg) has wandered into a strange situation where he watches all sorts of people killing each other! Why and what's it all about...watch the film to see."
Kill Me Three Times,"I noticed one reviewer who compared this to a Tarantino film--and that's a reasonable comparison. And, like some of his films, it is darkly funny but certainly not a comedy--such as what you'd see in ""Pulp Fiction"". Now I am not saying this Pegg film is in the same league as this Tarantino classic...but it is clever and well made. But it also starts off slow and seems pretty awful until all the story elements start coming together."
Kill Me Three Times,"I do not know why this film has such low reviews. It is not a big budget film but it is well made and funny throughout (if you like dark humour). The casting is excellent and Simon Pegg puts in a deliberately understated performance as the only professional killer among a whole bunch of nasty individuals. I have watched this again and again, because I notice a new nuance every time I view. Watch and enjoy. There are decidedly humorous but cringe-worthy moments throughout the film and the ""I'll be there in an hour"" catchphrase of his hired-killer has added significance towards the end (not really a spoiler - watch what I mean!) Lovely performances from many great actors/actresses - Simon Pegg is excellent - Bryan Brown is just so unlikable. The plot twists are fantastic. Watch and enjoy!"
Kill Me Three Times,Excellent all round fun crime movie with a perfectly woven plot combined with refreshing Australian scenery and acting. Put it to the top of your must see movies.
Kill Me Three Times,"It's the coastal community of Eagles Nest, Australia. Alice Taylor (Alice Braga) fears for her life from her husband Jack Taylor (Callan Mulvey). She's having an affair with Dylan Smith (Luke Hemsworth). Jack hires Charlie Wolfe (Simon Pegg) to spy on her and then for him to kill her. The movie starts with Charlie killing a man. Meanwhile, corrupt policeman Bruce Jones (Bryan Brown) is demanding payment for gambling debts from Nathan Webb (Sullivan Stapleton). Nathan is a dentist and his wife Lucy (Teresa Palmer) is his receptionist. They come up with a scheme to kill Alice, switch dental records with Lucy, and collect the insurance. Charlie photographs them kidnapping Alice and blackmails them. Bruce also blackmails Nathan for half of the insurance profit. Alice had taken a gun and $250k from her husband. It's a multi-layered crime story that is told one layer at a time."
Kill Me Three Times,"It's a complicated interconnected modern crime story that better directors have been doing. Those other movies have better dialog and cooler moves. Pegg playing against type is a little interesting. Unraveling the layers is somewhat compelling early on. However, the movie becomes less compelling as more is revealed. Despite all the mayhem, this isn't fun enough. This is not good enough."
Kill Me Three Times,"Sorry for the pun in the header, could not resist."
Kill Me Three Times,Will make this review short and sweet.
Kill Me Three Times,"Yes, indeed, it is possible to do a ""film noire"" in color with a modern theme. Look at BLUE RUIN (also reviewed by your humble scribe.) No seriously, go watch it, I will wait here patiently for you to come back. A truly great film, that one."
Kill Me Three Times,"That said, this is not a successful attempt on par with Blue Ruin. This is not a successful attempt at all."
Kill Me Three Times,"I have nothing against Pegg in a heavy dramatic role (other than the fact that viewers and reviewers seem to ""assume"" that if Pegg is in the film, this must be a comedy or a drama-comedy. I don't think so.) What I am against is any film that tries so hard to succeed it gives the viewer a giant headache. In fact the non-stop ""caper film"" sound track could give you a headache all by itself, assuming it was sold separately, which I hope never happens."
Kill Me Three Times,"Three stories, three takes of the same story, an ending where the beginning should be -- heady stuff even if you actually ARE Quentin Tarantino."
Kill Me Three Times,Not for amateurs.
Kill Me Three Times,Loved the Toronado. Great car. The actors were all interesting and tried to do the best they could with the script. Wasn't enough.
Kill Me Three Times,"A Tarantino inspired? film that lacks that director's touch to be something special. The plot involves complications that make sense given the characters. There are a couple of plot contrivances that stretch reality but aren't totally off the wall. The acting is fine but without the pizazz that makes Tarantino's characters so interesting. The main faults with KMTT are the lack of imagination in the cinematography and the pace. Careful editing could have taken a few minutes off the film, watching folks drive especially gets a bit old. Most of the scenes could have a bit shorter, for example someone opening a safe doesn't need to be seen several times. We get that safes have combinations and get opened. The comic timing, therefore, falls short and what could have been a very good movie is just above average. I can't quite give it a six, but a 7 seems too high. Call it 6.5."
Kill Me Three Times,"This film tells the story of a private investigator who is hired to investigate the suspected infidelity of a bar owner's wife. Many unexpected complications occur, and things get out of hand very quickly."
Kill Me Three Times,"I like Simon Pegg's films exactly because of the way ""Kill Me Three Times"" is. The story is a little grim but done in a funny way, hence it is still comedy despite so many people dying. The most funny thing is the irony of the events that happen to Alice, the unfortunate main character who is wanted dead by many people."
Kill Me Three Times,"I enjoyed watching ""Kill Me Three Times"". I hope there will be more films like this one."
Kill Me Three Times,"I love action comedies when there done right they are the best genre, come on bad boys.... this is a different action comedy featuring Simon pegg as a hit man come on need I say more????? Trust me it's a fun flick its not an oscar contender as its NOT boring. A little predictable but doesn't matter at least it doesn't end and you have to complete the movie on your own!!, I hate that!!"
Kill Me Three Times,Some of the reviews of this movie are puzzling (its also hard to take some of them seriously with the embarrassing misuse of the word 'to').
Kill Me Three Times,I don't see that anyone connected to this flick attempted to make an earth shattering film.. It was just a fun ride for me. I had a good time with this movie.
Kill Me Three Times,"In general I thought it was acted well. The music punched the Tarantino parallel, and added a fun tone. I thought it was worth seeing for sure.."
Kill Me Three Times,"I guess if you go in expecting a Tarantino flick, you will be disappointed - and evidently displeased that a movie would resemble one."
Kill Me Three Times,"A compulsive gambling man-child of a dentist, indifferent and strangely philosophical hit-man, plucky yet unlucky surfer girl, scheming and invasive chief of police, jealous and possessive playboy husband, studly yet brain-dead mechanic, money-grubbing Lady Macbeth of an administrative assistant, and beautiful, moonlit strands of Australian ocean shorelines, combine in this enthralling, dark and loopy comedy. Each of the incompatible and mismatched characters wants what the others have, and cannot see that they may have enough inside and around themselves. ""I am sick and tired of having barely enough,"" pleads one ""I want more, and so should you."" ""You don't love me,"" laments another, ""you just want to control me."" They double cross, misunderstand and backstab each other until only one of them is left standing. Simon Pegg, always entertaining in his repeat roles as a hapless and conniving conman, performs skillfully again here as the hit-man. Despite its brevity and a certain amount of shallowness, the film is engaging, insightful and fulfilling. Seen at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival."
Kill Me Three Times,This is how stories should be told. Kept me on the edge throughout!
Kill Me Three Times,"I do not understand why this title has so low rates. I have to admit I am a big fan of Simon Pegg that in this movie is great, but beside that this movie deserve a watch and it's really entertaining. The cast is good and the plot is nice and if you ever wonder why crime doesn't always pay....well you must watch it."
Kill Me Three Times,"Location, music and the overall direction is perfect for the plot but the most intriguing part is the way it's designed, with the beginning telling the end (even the title..) and the point of view from different angles and times."
Kill Me Three Times,"OK it's the same old story since Double Indemnity or Postman rings twice with a twist of Tarantino and McCarty point of view so if you expect something completely new you could be disappointed but if you just want to spend sometime relaxing and having fun, well, this is a right one !"
Kill Me Three Times,This movie is for you if
Kill Me Three Times,"What starts as an intriguing sequence of events turns into an edge of the seat affair by the time you are into the 30th minute. A must watch for thriller buffs and if you are a Simon Pegg fan, that's one more reason why you should not miss it."
Kill Me Three Times,"I've been put off by this film for ages because all the ratings and reviews are terrible but I completely disagree. The film actually had good structure to it. Had a few nice twists, the acting wasn't bad and it had a nice ending. It even made me chuckle a few times so there's no complaints on my end. If you're debating it, just watch it, it's worth it."
Kill Me Three Times,"Darkly humorous - a genre that Pegg loves, as well as comic in its delivery of hapless events, the story follows its characters, looping back to moments that add clarity to key plot points as it goes"
Kill Me Three Times,"I have a habit of rarely being able to finish a movie. If I am bored, I just cannot go through with it. I was intrigued by the trailer of Kill Me Three Times and so despite the IMDb rating and poor reviews I started watching it. And it was the right decision. The movie kept me glued and I was not expecting anything too complicated. It told a simple fun story that had its own twists. Loved it. Recommended if you want a lighthearted action comedy. The acting is good and the plot slowly opens up to keep you on it. Does not deliver memento style story. But this is entertaining nonetheless. Loved Pegg and his beginning commentary. Would have loved it more if it continued a bit more throughout the movie."
Kill Me Three Times,Like many other titles on IMDb i'm surprised by the low ratings and mixed reviews that this title received. I believe that watching a movie doesn't require me to be a professional critic or reviewer so i don't need to start nitpicking every little detail or the composition in it's entirety. That usually happens after a second or third viewing or at a much later time.
Kill Me Three Times,"With that being said, i find that this movie, like many others, deserves a chance to win you over. It might not be perfect, but what movie out there is? (Especially when you're looking for goofs and mistakes in every scene)"
Kill Me Three Times,"It's got a good mix of humor and action all narrated in an interestingly cut up way where not all facets of a sequence are revealed at once. The acting, soundtrack and location choices were also rather good and they fit well in this small world they created in the movie."
Kill Me Three Times,I for one had a good time watching it and if you do decided to give it a try i hope that you also do.
Kill Me Three Times,I think non-American humour is always under rated on IMDB. Lots of my favourite black comedies just seem to miss the mark with US reviewers and this is another example of that. It's a perfectly fun and enjoyable film with a good central role played by Simon Pegg. An entertaining couple of hours for when you don't want anything too taxing.
Kill Me Three Times,Kill Me Three Times is a blackly comic crime thriller set in Australia.
Kill Me Three Times,In the small coastal community Alice Taylor (Alice Braga) is suspicious of her abusive husband Jack Taylor (Callan Mulvey.) Jack has good reason for his suspicions as she is having an affair with mechanic Dylan Smith (Luke Hemsworth) and she also plans to steal from her husband and run away with Dylan.
Kill Me Three Times,"Jack hires hit-man Charlie Wolfe (Simon Pegg) to follow her and then take her out. Nathan Webb (Sullivan Stapleton) is a dentist, his wife Lucy (Teresa Palmer) is his receptionist and she is also Jack' sister."
Kill Me Three Times,"They have schemed to kill Alice, switch dental records with Lucy and collect from her life insurance as Nathan has gambling debts and is being shaken down by a corrupt cop."
Kill Me Three Times,"Charlie observes Alice being killed and surviving, it has the Tarantino type jumbled up narrative as well as heavy dose of violence but lacks the dark humour of the Coen brothers. As you watch the film more subplots are revealed as there is more backstabbing than a Roman senate meeting."
Kill Me Three Times,"Brazilian actress Braga shines, Pegg plays against type as a nasty hit-man who seems to bounce back more times than the Terminator. The film is derivative but improves as it goes along helped by its Australian setting."
Kill Me Three Times,"It was a hot and humid atmosphere, I thought they shot in Italy. Then came to know it was an Aussie flick when a dead kangaroo was shown. So Simon Pegg in an Australian film, that directed by one of my favourite dog movies 'Red Dog' famed filmmaker. On this, it was a mixed feeling to me. A comedy-thriller, a good time pass movie. The film editing and the screen presentation were what made it look a better flick. If it was told from the starting point to the end as a single line, then it would have been very ordinary."
Kill Me Three Times,"Barely there are eight actors, that mean it is a limited cast movie that takes place in the isolated location. All about love, cheating, crime, money, completely about the dark side desires. There are a couple of twists, that is only because of the bend in the storytelling. At the Beginning, the three different stories were told one after another that set in the same timeline. The first one was to introduce a hit-man, followed by a woman who cheats her husband and the finally a dentist couple who was threatened by a loan shark."
Kill Me Three Times,"There are no good guys in the story. All of them has some issues and they want to get rid of it from their lives. So the plot begins to explode once they committed to their plans that does not go as it should be. When a series of mistakes and characters and their situation overlaps with each other, that lead to the finale."
Kill Me Three Times,"There are some minor plot holes, if you don't compare it with the Hollywood blockbusters like critics then possibly you would enjoy it. I won't suggest it if you are looking for a Tarantino style masterpiece. It is a little dark- comedy from the down-under that has its own value despite there are some similarities with other flicks."

Poltergeist,"I was a huge Poltergeist fan when i was a little kid and was really scared of the original movies when i saw them on TV in the late 80s or early 90s. It had everything a good movie should have. a good script, good actors, good director... this one had none of those. the actors feel unmotivated. the script was rewritten to add the typical 21century Hollywood movie formula and the director didn't know what he was doing anyway..."
Poltergeist,"don't watch this remake... stay with the original! its scarier anyway, even today!"
Poltergeist,Have you seen it? No? There is likely a very good reason for that...it stinks.
Poltergeist,"Like nearly ALL the endless remakes and reboots that have been plaguing movie goers for the past decade or so....all this is, is a heartless version of the original."
Poltergeist,It has no heart.
Poltergeist,It has no soul.
Poltergeist,"It is a retelling of a film that we all love and cherish...and it adds nothing to the story. It improves nothing but the special effects--which held up very well over time--and in some cases belittles the fans of the original...particularly in the fact that they remade the movie at all, without adding anything clever to it."
Poltergeist,Like so many other remakes it is a hallow shell of the original.
Poltergeist,"Poor remake. Zero real scares. Nonsensical reactions from the family.
The young boy just can't act ....or was badly directed. Just widening the eyes a little and walking everywhere tentatively in slow motion steps isn't convincing anyone. He walks through most of the movie like this and it became really annoying very quickly."
Poltergeist,People see the most shocking things and then don't even mention it!?
Poltergeist,"Whomever wrote the script should be ashamed of themselves. Truly terrible.
Totally unbelievable characters and reactions. Plot holes and stupid dialogue."
Poltergeist,Watch the original.
Poltergeist,"One plus.
The 3D was great fun. (If a little forces at times)
Blatant cash in that fell flat on its face."
Poltergeist,"While the original Poltergeist had us gripping the movie theater armchairs, this one in not only bland, unimaginative and bords on plagiarism. Don't loose your time, even if there's nothing else to watch. Watch the original again ; it will please you more."
Poltergeist,I wonder why producers dump their money on these garbage pieces.
Poltergeist,"Director Gil Kenan is relatively new in the director's chair, and unfortunately it shows. This modernized telling of the classic original is neither scary nor convincing. The acting was merely ok and the effects so-so. I'd rather watch the original ten times over than to watch this remake a second time."
Poltergeist,They say you should never remake a classic. The original Poltergeist from 1982 was written by Steven Spielberg who also seemed to have had a hand in how it was directed.
Poltergeist,The 2015 remake is a soulless movie that brings nothing new to the table except a few jump cuts.
Poltergeist,If it was an innovative reimagination whose reach could not exceed its grasp I might had been more forgiving.
Poltergeist,"Sam Rockwell is an out of work father, Eric Bowen who with his wife Amy Bowen and three young kids move into a new home. The house was built in an old cemetery and the bodies were supposed to have been moved but only the headstones were."
Poltergeist,"The youngest daughter Madison feels a presence, the spirits below the house need a guide and Madison is sucked in and disappears."
Poltergeist,The Bowens call on paranormal psychics Dr Brooke Powell (Jane Adams) and Carrigan Burke (Jared Harris) to get her back.
Poltergeist,The only thing to note is London born Jared doing an impression of his Irish father Richard Harris.
Poltergeist,"The psychic they made out to be some guy faking it through his life instead of like in the original where she was legit and respected. Most scenes from the first are there, but NONE of the original scenes are even close to being half as good as the original. Remember ""There herrreeee"", well, there was no life in it when this girl repeated the same line. The casting was not bad. I think it was the director and script writers that really butchered this. The first movie had an atmosphere about it. This had nothing. I have seen B flicks with better atmosphere."
Poltergeist,I cannot recommend this movie unless you are really bored or maybe want to compare to the original. Or you are just tired of banging your head against the wall.
Poltergeist,"POLTERGEIST is another pointless remake of a classic horror film which they didn't have a hope of improving upon. The only difference between the two films are some artificial changes in which the story is 'updated' with needless modern technology including drones and tablets, none of which adds anything to the story. As expected, it starts out subtly but descends into the usual CGI-augmented nonsense come the climax, and the story in between has no heart or depth at all. The scares are anything but frightening, and the low quality is rounded out by the generally poor performances, from a slumming-it Sam Rockwell (you can tell his heart isn't really in it) to the mildly embarrassing kids, and Jared Harris chewing the scenery. This isn't the worst remake out there, and if you hadn't seen the original I can imagine you might find the story interesting, but for everyone else, it's really not worth your time."
Poltergeist,"This movie might just be a remake, but it's not. In fact, it seems to have taken very little from its predecessors in title. The script is banal: as it has happened in thousands of films before, a family with children moves to a new house, acquiring without knowing the (not very encouraging) possibility of being frightened by an endless series of ghosts. Of course, children will be the preferred target of these ghosts, be it by the ingenuity or the effect that this can provoke in the public. Nothing new here. Equally unoriginal (we've seen something similar in ""Insidious"" or ""The Conjuring""), the wardrobe in the girl's room is the most active place, eventually ""devouring"" one of the children. I will not talk more about what happens in this movie so I will not spoil. I just wanted to demonstrate that the film is a succession of cliches."
Poltergeist,"Gil Kenan's direction proved to be poor, fragile and did not seem to have been able to ask for the best of the actors and staff members. A lazy direction, which is content with the medium without pursuing excellence. The scares are scarce and predictable: objects that jump towards the display, snoring, scary noises and lights. I can say that I never felt truly frightened while watching the film. About the actors what can be said is that they seem to me to have tried to fulfill their role well, but they were not directed effectively. Sam Rockwell and Rosemarie DeWitt fulfilled their roles, while the children (especially Kennedi Clements and Kyle Catlett) seem to have fully lived up to what was asked of them. Jared Harris and Jane Adams do not seem to have been good choices, a complete casting error."
Poltergeist,"This film is a far cry from the quality of the Poltergeist of the 1980s, and I do not know if it's honest to relate these films to this movie. This seems a bit too ambitious, even though they share the same name. Despite this, I have the feeling that it would have been better with a more creative script and a more demanding and skillful director."
Poltergeist,"No review can tell you how bad it is. Bad acting, bad story, bad effects, bad remake, boring, predictable, pointless.
If you really wanna watch this... Go out, do something else until it goes away, really."
Poltergeist,"I was really hoping that someone could pull this off but apprantly not even the great Sam Rami could muster up enough talent to save this God-awful remake.Sometimes remakes end up better than the original because of all the new tech, but nothing could pull this steaming pile of waste out of the toilet. I wonder if they dosed the entire crew with sleeping pills the acting was so dead. Esp the father behaved in ways I have never seen a real father behave, where in the hell do they their actors?
I have seen more talent at high school plays, and who wrote this crap unbelievable lines coming from unbelievable actors. I am sure my cat could deliver lines that would be more believable. The Original Poltergeist is a shining gem, this remake was a Steaming pile of excrement and that is putting it nicely. waste you time if you want, I guess that will pass time while we are all quarantine.or better yet watch the Original and have a good scare."
Poltergeist,The 3 stars I gave goes to the 1st 30 minutes. That means the rest of this production is really annoying.
Poltergeist,"The movie works better if you watch it as drama rather than a horror movie. I know fans of the original will go/call sacrilege (but they'd do that anyway ... well mostly). But if you watch this as a family drama (and I'm certain this was intended, seeing Sam Rockwell and his interpretation of the role), you will get more out of it. It is fairly decent considering that."
Poltergeist,"Of course that's only true for fans of the genre (Horror), others who are not used to Horror might not see it exactly the same way. There are frightening scenes in this don't get me wrong, but anyone with a little ""experience"" will see them coming and will not be entertained (or scared for that matter) by them. The acting though? Pretty solid by everyone involved - again not if seen as Horror. Can you dig that? If so watch, if not, you've been warned"
Poltergeist,"I can't really remember the original. I do know that when it comes to horror I prefer practical effects over cgi. And this remake has way too much cgi. The old one of course only had practical effects. I still don't remember it as scary though. Except one scene where a technician in horror thinks he's pulling his own face off. This being PG13, we only get a scene where an annoying rude Ashton Kutcher-type-technician gets his arm stuck and is almost getting a drill into his face. Pretty lame.Especially considering the scene just before where it would have been nice if he had been killed by the drill."
Poltergeist,The acting goes from bad to decent to bad to decent again. And there are plot holes biggger than the one in the little girls closet.
Poltergeist,"For a family that has lost their youngest daughter to angry spirits, they remain very calm, only to break down a couple of times. If I had kids and one of them had gone missing, I would be terrified all the time, unable to eat or sleep."
Poltergeist,"As far as plot holes go, the entire movie is a major plothole, like how a father who was recently fired, can get a bankloan to buy a house.Especially since the mother isn't working How the family can just borrow the ghost hunters car at the end of the movie, only to never give it back and never come back for their own car. How the father with cancelled creditcards can buy expensive gifts for his family. How they're forcing their boy to sleep in the attic,. when he's terrified. How they find creepy clown dolls in his closet and don't get rid of them, even though they scare the boy."
Poltergeist,As far as the girl gone missing this was done way better in Insidious where a boy went missing the exact same way. And most likely much better in the original Poltergeist movie.
Poltergeist,"If you can live with all these plot holes and some annoying characters, acting illogical in many situations, then you will like this movie. If you want good acting and real scare, watch Insidious instead."
Poltergeist,"POLTERGEIST (2015) **1/2 Sam Rockwell, Rosemarie DeWitt, Saxon Sharbino, Kyle Catlett, Kennedi Clements, Jared Harris, Jane Adams, Susan Heyward, Nicholas Braun. Yet another unnecessary remake to a classic film of the past with varying degrees of success. To wit: pointless nearly sequence-to-sequence Xerox of the '80s spookfest unleashed by Steven Spielberg and Tobe Hooper about a family plagued by a pesky and deadly supernatural force upon moving into a new cul-de-sac that latches onto the youngest daughter (cute Clements who eerily echoes the original's late, Heather O'Rourke, only dark-haired), prompting a ghost hunter (Harris) and his ex, a researcher of the paranormal (Adams) enlisted to rescue the girl and 'clean house'. Director Gil Kenan is by-no-means a Spielberg (or a Hooper) but attempts to enliven the predictable proceedings at hand no thanks to the lackluster script by David Lindsay-Abaire. The CGI makes up for the poorly conceived reboot; better off renting (or even better off buying) the original."
Poltergeist,"Director Gil Kenan, with some advise from a master of fright, Sam Raimi, brings an original up to date. WOW; it is like moving from kindergarten to grad school. Eric Bowen(Sam Rockwell)moves his family to a new home, against most of their wishes. Son Griffin(Kyle Catlett)is the major objector, but who listens to a kid? When Griffin finds his little sister Madison(Kennedi Clements)talking to the TV screen in the middle of the night...this is the big hint that malevolent spirits are the real owners of the house. When apparitions take little Maddie hostage...hellish activities commence. Serious enough to call in TV ""ghost hunter"" Carrigan Burke(Jared Harris)."
Poltergeist,"I really like this version over the 1982 original. Sure, graphics have improved and frightening sequences are intense and creepy. This film is good enough to leave the story alone. Cynical Rockwell brings a bit of humor to the horror. Harris is almost over-the-top, but actually a hoot. Miss Catlett is a cutie for sure."
Poltergeist,"Also in the cast: Rosemarie DeWitt, Saxon Sharbino, Jane Adams and Nicolas Braun."
Poltergeist,Greetings from Lithuania.
Poltergeist,"""Poltergeist"" (2015) is a poor remake of a good original movie, but it is not the worst flick on it's own. That said, ""Poltergeist"" (2015) is kinda nicely acted, although i didn't buy Sam Rockwell's performance - he was miscast or maybe he new this is going to be poor movie so acted just for fun, but it is clear that this wasn't his favorite job to say the least. Kinds did OK job, especially one who played Griffin, and Rosemarie DeWitt's performance was probably the best in this movie."
Poltergeist,"As a horror movie, ""Poltergeist"" (2015) features tons of clichés, and there aren't true scary moments, you can see ""jump scare"" scenes from a mile. What i enjoyed about this movie was not the horror elements, but simply family scenes especially during first hour of this movie, but when so called ""horror"" starts, movie started to drag and by the end i was watching left time like each 5 min."
Poltergeist,"Overall, ""Poltergeist"" (2015) isn't good, but it isn't particularly bad. If you loved the original, it is nice for seeing it once just for nostalgia, but if you are looking for a decent horror movie, this isn't the one."
Poltergeist,"An absolutely pointless remake of the classic collaboration between Tobe Hooper and Steven Spielberg. The three stars I gave this are strictly for Sam Rockwell's acting chops. Nothing else and I mean nothing else works. The kids are annoying., the mother is forgettable and the poltergeist hunters are dull. Terrible special effects that are crappy CGI copies of the groundbreaking original movies' practical effects are everywhere in this dumpster fire. Forget this and watch the original classic."
Poltergeist,"Horror movies are my favorite, but I'm not the type of horror movie fan that will simply judge a movie on its horribly photoshopped cover or generally hold holier than thou attitudes toward technique, execution, writing, and cinematography (although I will bask in the glory of these done well), especially when it comes to remakes. I like to give them the benefit of the doubt."
Poltergeist,"Poltergeist (2015) was no different. I had wanted to see it for quite awhile but wasn't convinced that it was a movie I needed to buy for $14.99 (thanks iTunes for your options, btw). After watching it tonight (for free, streaming online) the only two things that keep resounding in my head are ""Thank you inner voice for telling me not to hit the purchase button"" and ""OMG. Worst. Remake. Ever."" In fact, I will go as far as to say that it's probably one of the worst horror attempts I've ever seen."
Poltergeist,"I don't need to include spoilers here. If you've seen the original, you know the story. This ""remake"" definitely assumes you have and gives not even a second thought to the story, nor does it even pretend it cares. It's an afterthought, at best. Actually, this whole movie seems and comes off as an afterthought. This remake was not made by someone wanting to expand upon or do any service artistically to the original. No, this is a pure, unadulterated cash grab at best. At its worst, this is a slap in the face to the horror genre for a quick buck, to fans of horror and to the original altogether."
Poltergeist,"I won't pretend the original Poltergeist is the best horror movie ever made, it's definitely always been cheesy in its own way. Yet, it managed to make me squirm, creeped me out, and kept me entranced whethercwatching it as a child or as an adult. The original Poltergeist is everything that this film is not...."
Poltergeist,"This ""remake"" is sloppy, careless, poorly executed and poorly written, all while the actors struggle to pull out performances (even a talented actor like Sam Rockwell comes off disengenuous). It is lazily shot with more early 2000s-esque CGI than anyone should be asked to swallow for 2015...and is as scary as a wet dish towel."
Poltergeist,"There are exactly two moments in this film that I was slightly taken aback, but most definitely not scared, shocked, or surprised in the least. Mostly, I laughed or shook my head in embarrassment or dismay from how awful what just happened on screen actually was. Definitely not a crowning achievement."
Poltergeist,"Yes, the young newcomer actress is cute, and does her best...but you're not given an opportunity to care about what happens to her character or her family."
Poltergeist,"My husband fell asleep 7 times (I counted), and afterward said ""People standing around in a white sheet have been scarier and more interesting"". I agree."
Poltergeist,"Some remakes are good, most are bad, and unfortunately for Poltergeist and horror fans this trainwreck is the latter. It's a shame in a way because if it had been done well, it could have been pretty awesome."
Poltergeist,"Watch it, or don't, just don't buy it. You'll regret it. I promise. And most of all, do not expect to be satiated, scared or impressed in the least."
Poltergeist,"Due to competitions that utilize atmosphere and thrill aspect better, this remake of Poltergeist would probably not be as memorable as the original. It also follows the premise rather rigidly, which by now is already outdated. However, it may just present a couple of horror gimmicks bizarre enough to at least entertain the new generation."
Poltergeist,"Story is predictable, a family is haunted by an unknown entity and the daughter is in danger of being abducted. Usually audience would react unfavorably towards the stiff plot, but considering that the original sets up this theme for the genre, some degree of lenience is warranted. For the acting, this family doesn't really stand out from the rest of haunting victims, although the child actors perform pretty well since much of the movie invests on them."
Poltergeist,"The original's creepy atmosphere is definitely superior. It has the luxury of being made in simpler time. The remake does try to produce the same effect, yet it feels lacking on a few notes. Movies like Insidious or Sinister arguably have better ambiance and set up, so it opts for a more literal modern touch."
Poltergeist,"Instead of practical effects, Poltergeist uses plenty of CGI, especially towards the latter half. It has its pro and con, the first being it has more peculiar look, which might not be better than most horror flicks but it does stand out. The flaw is it takes much of the horror away. It dabbles more on shocking visual than instilling dread that culminate in fright, the effectiveness of such method hinges on one's taste."
Poltergeist,"In a way Poltergeist tries to modernize itself, it doesn't reach the same air of its original, but the sense of uniqueness helps in presenting a decent eccentric spectacle."
Poltergeist,"I can understand that the studio wanted to do a remake of Poltergeist (1982). It became famous due a few reasons, was it Spielberg or Hooper who directed this flick, the sad news was the fact that the film was cursed as they said back then, Carol Anne Freeling, the young focal point of the series, was played by Heather O'Rourke. Only six years old when the first Poltergeist film was released, O'Rourke captivated audiences with her stark blond hair, doll-like appearance, and big, inquisitive eyes. Sadly, however, she was misdiagnosed with Crohn's Disease in 1987. The following year, O'Rourke fell ill again, and her symptoms were casually attributed to the flu. A day later, she collapsed and suffered a cardiac arrest. After being airlifted to a children's hospital in San Diego, O'Rourke died during an operation to correct a bowel obstruction, and it was later believed that she had been suffering from a congenital intestinal abnormality. She will be, and has been, missed by fans around the world."
Poltergeist,"Even as it didn't make it into the classics of the horror buffs it was still worth seeing, no gore or whatsoever but it worked out fine for the family and it spawned a few sequels."
Poltergeist,"This remake of course is literally remade shot by shot. Some will love it others will ask what's the point of doing so. For example the remake of Evil Dead didn't do that and look, it's loved by gorehounds. Still, you will recognise the trees haunting the house, the rope being thrown in the hole, the famous sentence, ""they're here"", the house falling in pieces. You know what I mean. It was fun to see it done today with CGI ghosts but a classic it never will become. Ideal to watch with your teenagers at home, nothing more, nothing less."
Poltergeist,The extended cut doesn't add anything towards the scary parts or characterization. The 3D does give it an extra touch towards the horror and the scary moments.

Poltergeist,"I am not one of these people that is adamantly against remakes. They can be done properly and some of my favourite horror films are remakes. I love the original Poltergeist films (definitive classics!) and I had high hopes for this film that it would be a new generation of the classic scare-fest. The cast seemed good and the trailer certainly gave us something to look forward to. The delivery of this remake unfortunately is average in every way. It isn't bad, it isn't good and its mostly forgettable. They do try to capture some of the original scenes but they really leave a bad taste in the mouth as the new cast doesn't quite have the same level of pizazz that the original did. Scares feel few and far between and even stale in some instances. The new wave of Horror films all feel the same which is fine because it is a familiar genre but there really needs to be something that stands out to make a modern day horror film genuinely creepy like Insidious was or the oustandingly violent and twisted Evil Dead remake. The one thing I looked forward to in this remake was the infamous line ""They're here,"" and it was delivered so poorly and so matter-of-factly that it almost dragged the movie down."
Poltergeist,"The main cast are all talented people but somehow the script doesn't give them enough. Sam Rockwell is an excellent actor but this role wasn't right for him. He didn't have that everyone's Dad quality that Craig T Nelson had in the original. It felt as though he just wasn't sure what to do with the character. Rosemarie DeWitt fits the role well but isn't given enough to really make a difference in the film and her chemistry with Rockwell is average at best so she gets left behind. Saxon Sharbino, Kyle Catlett and Kennedi Clements play the children and unfortunately Sharbino and Catlett get very little development as characters and Clements who certainly looks the role doesn't get nearly enough development to her character and therefore doesn't even come close to that of Heather O'Rourke in the original film. The entire family should have been such a major focus and you should really feel their terror and you don't. Then you factor in the lack of ""the expert."" You know the person who comes in to rid the family of their terror whether it be The Exorcist or something of the like. Jared Harris is hardly a blip in the cast and is completely forgettable in a vital role."
Poltergeist,The problem with this remake and many of the same similar horror films is that it is aimed at late teen-early twenty audiences that just want a little chuckle and don't really want to be scared. I mean you look at director Gil Kenan who's major project prior to this was an animated scare flick and you wonder why Kenan would have been chosen to helm a project that was originally helmed by a master like Tobe Hooper and co-written by Steven Spielberg. I mean I can understand people's hesitation for remakes when the proper respect is not paid to the original source. Poltergeist unfortunately is a second-rate remake with very little care put into it. It is mildly entertaining at best but even worse when you try and hold it against the original. It really is average in every way. I wanted to really like it and instead its already forgotten. 6/10
Poltergeist,"Let's get this out of the way: Remakes never surpass the originals (aside from very rare cases like John Carpenter's The Thing). The premise is the same - a family moves into a house that's haunted with a poltergeist, their daughter gets trapped into the ""spirit"" realm and they hire an expert to help the family get her out. It's essentially a retelling of the original story with a few tweaks and a ton of CGI. So is Poltergeist one of the rare instances where the remake is as good or better than the original? F*ck no. But that doesn't mean it has no entertainment value as a standalone horror flick."
Poltergeist,"Poltergeist is a popcorn movie more than anything. Everything about it, from the poor writing to the lukewarm thrills, only provide surface-level enjoyment. It never gets under your skin like a good horror film should. It's not scary or disturbing, and it definitely won't stick with you once the credits start to roll. The problem is that Poltergeist is extremely formulaic and predictable. They set up these creepy scenarios and build up suspense by making it really quiet for a few moments, and then a few seconds later... BAM, loud noise and creepy face jumps at you. I love me a good jump scare but the scares are cheap and you can see them coming from a mile away. It's a shame because there are moments where you can tell the director is trying to build tension and unease, but these easy scares ruin any momentum the atmosphere had going for it."
Poltergeist,"Acting wise, Sam Rockwell is the obvious highlight. He's a very talented, likable actor and elevates any scene he's in just by his presence. He could have easily done this role in his sleep or on auto-pilot but Rockwell commits to the part and is by far the most watchable and relatable character in the movie. The family dynamic feels real solely because of him. Jared Harris gives a great performance as well considering the limited screen time he was given."
Poltergeist,"Which brings me to the characters themselves, and this is where the movie fails. Hard. The only characters that feel ""real"" are the father, the son, and the younger daughter (who isn't used nearly as much as she was in the original). Everyone else is just... there. The mother and older daughter add literally nothing to the story, the paranormal team members are completely forgettable and are only there for exposition, hell even Jared Harris' character is a huge wasted opportunity. It's the fault of the writers really. I mean there is some truly *cringeworthy* dialogue that's so unbelievable that it looks as if the actors are just reading off cue cards. And then they throw in a really really dumb love subplot between Jared Harris and the lead investigator which was a waste of time and excruciatingly awkward to watch."
Poltergeist,"This movie does polish some classic scenes from the original. The living tree, the clowns (yes, multiple), the subterranean graveyard, etc. It all looks sleek, smooth, and modern. But again, the novelty factor is gone so you pretty much know how everything is going to play out. There's one iconic scene that they butchered though, anyone who's seen the movie knows exactly what I'm talking about. It just felt half-assed and shoehorned in simply because it was such a powerful scene in the original and the filmmakers probably felt obligated to throw it in. The difference is that the original version was haunting and unexpected while this version lasts for like a split second and leaves you feeling absolutely nothing."
Poltergeist,"Again, there's no point in comparing this to its original because it pales in comparison in every way. It's one of the better recent horror remakes sure but that isn't saying much. However, as a standalone B-horror midnight popcorn creepfest, Poltergeist can provide a modicum of entertainment."
Poltergeist,5.5/10
Poltergeist,"I'd have to say I wasn't a big fan of this franchise, though I do remember watching the Poltergeist films the 3rd one especially."
Poltergeist,"The film begins with a family who move into a new house in the neighbourhood. Aside from the typical cliché's ranging from the eldest daughter being bitter & the daughter seeing & hearing things along with other cliché's here & there, it was decent enough film."
Poltergeist,"The jump scares was decent enough, though few & far between. But got my friend a good couple of times!"
Poltergeist,"The bit I liked the most was the toy clown lunging onto Griffon, that was pretty intense & scary! Unlike other horrors this actually didn't shy away & don't show you what happens this film actually did & it was ace, just like the scene where the father drinks whisky & spits out (what he is manipulated into thinking) is worms & mud! Disgusting but ace! Along with the scene with the drill & the wardrobe that was amazingly done!"
Poltergeist,"I thought the ending was abit too far fetched & Sci-Fi like, especially the part where the youngest daughter gets caught into the spirit world & lost & one of the family members has to go in & save her! This was more or less a bit of a rip off of the Insidious films abit but OK for a film that is remaking an original with better effects & editing!"
Poltergeist,It was overall a decent film which I'm giving 8/10 stars for as it was decent & far better than it's original which old people are so fixated on! Though it's usual clichés here & there it was a great film with great effects & scenes which made it a great horror film it was a pretty good remake as a whole & hope for sequels to follow!
Poltergeist,8/10
Poltergeist,"I do not like remakes, but Poltergeist is an exception. Well acted and direct Poltergeist remake crafts and entertaining story. If I compare Poltergeist to the original one notices how acting, and directing has improved over the years, but the original Poltergeist was and still is a great story. The director emulates an easy going dad, and scared little boy into likable characters which resonates with the viewers. The character development creates an empathy for the family's poltergeist problem. Poltergeist pays homage to the original and excellently executes the stall worth Doll clown, tree bedroom, and portal closet scenes. Poltergeist the remake pays enough homage to the original, but different enough to be it own movie. I like Poltergeist! Seven scares out of ten."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"From the great cast and idea, as well as the trailer being as entertaining as it was, What We Did On Our Holiday did look really promising. And it didn't disappoint, one or two tonal shifts jar just a tad and the material for David Tennant and Rosamund Pike wasn't quite as strong as that for the children and Billy Connolly(though it wasn't at all bad either) but it's a lovely film overall that entertains and touches. What We Did On Our Holiday is well-shot, never doing too much or too little, complementing the gorgeous scenery adeptly, while the soundtrack is appropriately understated and the film's sympathetically directed, allowing the story to resonate, the script to sparkle, accommodating the actors and using the idea to its full potential. There is a perfect balance of humour and pathos in the script, the humour especially with the children is often laugh-out-loud funny and the dramatic pathos parts are genuinely poignant. The story always engages and apart from at the end slightly it never feels too predictable, there are a number of surprises and What We Did On Our Holiday has a lot to say about family life and deals with it sympathetically and warmly in a way that allows us to completely identify with the situation and the characters, who all have a great amount of likability. The performances are excellent with the interplay between the actors even stronger, the chemistry between Connolly and the children is just adorable. David Tennant and Rosamund Pike are fine though Connolly and the children make much more of an impact, mainly due to better material. Connolly is very funny and also very moving, not just the character's situation which is enough to break anybody's heart but also it felt like a personal performance with Connolly being as gifted at comedy as he is and his ailing health. The children steal the show, Harriet Turnball is just hilarious and Emilia Jones also plays her role with a lot of charm. All in all, a lovely film that promised a good deal and delivers even more. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

Hoping to put on a united front so as to not upset Gordie any further, nobody could envisage what was to happen next..."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"It's a film that some no doubt find easy to kick, such is the uncomplicated structure used, and the formula of messaging that drives it forward. Yet sometimes uncomplicated is all you need, and in this day and age of mega-buck blockbusters and soulless frat type comedies grasping at sex for laughs, this is a film of refreshing qualities. It's superbly performed by what is a top notch group of adult British actors, who in turn are supplemented by three child actors so natural and engaging it makes you wonder if acting school is really needed?"
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"It's obviously a piece that will resonate more with those who have been touched/stung by the thematics at work, while the comedy ticking away - with some truly great lines uttered - could seem a bit off kilter for the unprepared, but hopefully more will watch it, laugh and cry and ultimately realise that life really is too short for, well, you get the picture I'm sure. 8/10"

hat We Did on Our Holiday,David Tennant looks the right kind of perplexed in the comedy trying to figure out his children and marriage whilst Rosamund Pike complements him beautifully with her engaged acting. Ben Miller as Gavin is brilliant as well. Billy Connolly ices the funny storyline with his pizazz and brilliant comic timing.
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"The screenplay is witty, subtle and snappy. The good thing about its humour is that the entire film, unlike other comedies, is not build on a slapstick foundation. The theme of the movie sometimes goes really thoughtful from sheer comedy which further furbishes the rhythm. The plot will make you giggle per se without any extra addition to the story."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"If you look at the downsides, sometimes you do hope the drama to be a little bit more grave. It lacks profundity, but considering it a Comedy, this fact can be overlooked."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,A brilliant comedy that is compelled to traverse the 'outstanding category' by the mere cuteness rush of Harriet Turnbull and Bobby Smalldridge. This Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin project is a definite go go!
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"Doug (David Tennant) and Abi (Rosamund Pike) are taking their three children to Scotland for Grandad Gordie (Billy Connolly)'s 75th birthday party. Gordie's cancer is terminal, so they want to avoid mention of their marital problems (they have recently split up following infidelities). Shenanigans ensue."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"This comedy centres on the stresses which affect families and does not shy away from difficult issues. But it is based around the children who are, for the most part, very good (and far from overshadowed by the heavyweights with whom they are performing). For the most part, this film is very funny and quite joyful. A particular delight is the interplay between earnest and old before her time 10-year old Lottie (a charming performance from Emilia Jones) and the grandfather who has never really grown up."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"There are criticisms: there is an air of TV sitcom about it – hardly surprising given that it comes from the BBC via a sitcom background, not all the threads started pay off, and the ending leans towards glibness. But these are minor quibbles as there is much to enjoy here."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"30 September 2014 First Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - What We Did On Our Holiday. A wonderful BBC production starring Rosamund Pike, David Tennant and the Big Yin himself Billy Connolly. Add to that three very talented and entertaining young actors and you have a film that is a giggle from start to finish. Abi (Pike) and Doug (Tennant) are going through a bitter divorce but trying to hide it from their very astute children. As a family they are heading to Scotland to celebrate Doug's Dad's (Connolly) 75th birthday. With a hard fought for agreement with their kids the couple decide to hide their troubles from the rest of the family in Scotland and what follows is a hilarious series of events led by the children an their irascible grandfather. I came out at the end and said 'I can't believe they did that!!!!!', you need to go and see this film to see what I mean. A great advert for Scotland too. The scenery was beautiful."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"We all loved this - me, my friend and my 2 daughters, 13 and 11. It's about a warring couple on the brink of divorce who take their three young children on holiday to Scotland to visit the husband's father, who has terminal cancer, on the occasion of his 75th birthday. It turns into an even more surprising birthday than anyone has imagined. David Tennant, Rosamund Pike, Billie Connolly, Ben Miller and Amelia Bullmore are all wonderful actors playing their parts to perfection and the children were as stunningly natural and funny as the children in the TV series Outnumbered. Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin had a great idea and have turned it into a funny and moving film. An extremely poignant scene was beautifully acted and directed and there were a fair few belly laughs as well as tears shed. There was some swearing but nothing worse than they hear routinely at secondary school, so though it was rated 12A I was never uncomfortable I'd taken my 11 year old daughter. Go and see it!"
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"When estranged couple Doug and Abi and their three children; Lottie, Mickey and Jess, head north to Scotland to attend the birthday of Doug's father, Gordie, things don't start well and quickly get worse. Having finally got the children into the car, got past the congested roads and arrived at Doug's brother's mansion in the West Highlands things are no better; Doug doesn't want his father to know he is getting divorced and he doesn't want the children to learn that their grandfather is terminally ill but inevitable secrets come out. Things turn from awkward to tragic when Gordie dies during a trip to the beach with the children leaving them to decide what to do next and as he had spoken of how he would like a Viking funeral they give him one something that obviously disturbs the adults when they learn about it just as the birthday guests arrive."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"This might not sound like comedy material but it manages to be hilarious even when tragedy strikes thanks to a witty script from writers Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin and a great cast. This cast is led by some well-known actors including David Tennant, Rosamund Pike and a particularly good Billy Connolly however it is the performances of the youngsters Emilia Jones, Bobby Smalldridge and Harriet Turnbull, as Lottie, Mickey and Jess, that make the film such fun. They are neither overly precocious nor wooden even when the situations are somewhat unlikely their performances make their actions believable. While there is a happy ending it didn't feel like a cop out; it is a comedy after all speaking of cop outs I was sure the adults would turn up and stop the Viking funeral right up until the point they set fire to the makeshift raft they had made for their grandfather; it was a relief that they weren't stopped as their actions led to some of the films funniest moments when people learn what they have done. The setting, in Wester Ross on Scotland's west coast, is quite stunning showing part of the country all too few people get to see. Overall this was a lot of fun; the comedy had me laughing till I cried and the poignant scene of Geodie's death had be shedding a few tears of sorrow. There are some parts that parents might not considered suitable for younger children, hence the '12' certificate, but I suspect children over that age will enjoy it as much as adult viewers."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"Brilliant acting by all 3 children. Many clever lines that had the audience laugh out loud. Super Scottish scenery and great advert for Wester Ross as a wonderful escape location, Slightly contrived happy ever after resolution but good light hearted family viewing. Great ostriches. And a view of kids grasp of the adult world. Enjoy the violin playing and jig at the end but bring air plugs for Thr practice sessions. Traditional portrayal of Scottish rural police! Imrie is in her element as a small character role; heart warming."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,Good look at family dynamics and relationships. Connolly plays a wonderful loving Grandfather who shows wise approach to difficult members of his family as he comes face to face with his own death.
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"Absolutely loved this film. I laughed, I smiled and I cried."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,The script is quirky and wonderfully imaginative. In an hour and a half 'What we did on our Holiday' manages to dissect family life and reconstruct it to embrace every aspect of the complete gamut of the generations and their interactions. And it does so with both sympathy and hilarity.
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"Of all films ever, it's the one that has made me feel best about being human. Flawed is fine in each and every generation, but the beginnings and endings are infinitely easier than the muddle in the middle."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,The acting throughout is exceptional but the child actors deserve a sky-fall of medals. Great stuff!
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"I will always think of this as a feature-length 2.4 Children. It made me laugh aloud, it made me shed a tear. There was one tiny subplot that wasn't tied up (Odin) which lost it a point, but well worth seeing. Family friendly, because, honestly, what kid hasn't heard swearing before?"
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"The kids are fabulous, the adults are insane and the whole mess of a birthday party is hilariously tragic. I will happily look out for more films by this writer/director pair."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"Have a watch of this film. A slight niggle is the unrealistic speed with which they navigated the M25. That just doesn't happen in real life, though the standstill traffic on the M1 was spot on."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,'What We Did On Our Holiday' is about a couple (with some issues) and their three kids (with their own quirks) who travel to Scotland to visit their very ill grandfather.
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"I went into this movie blind and the only thing I read was what was on the poster, ""Hilarious British comedy at its best"", and for the most part, it lived up to that. Pretty much all the comedic moments had the theatre laughing. And what I did not expect was for the three young kids to be as hilarious as they were. The best part of the movie, in my opinion, was the middle part of the movie with the three kids spending time with their grandfather (played by Billy Connolly who was brilliant). The sad moments of the movie were also well done, much to my heart's displeasure."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"The only problem I had with the movie were the parents of the three kids. They were a few jokes that did not feel right, especially one scene where they fight in the bathroom."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"Still, this is a great movie to watch. It has a few surprises and for once the kids make this movie awesome. The ending was also decent, although a bit more predictable than the rest of the movie."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"What a great film this is, carrying on in the Great British tradition of Local Hero and Whisky Galore. It has been a long time since I heard such laughter in a cinema and everyone came out with smiles. Now it's not some daft children's film, on the surface it looks a simple feel good romp, but it's not, it goes to very interesting places and it really took me by surprise. Set in Scotland it looks superb (I'm a sucker for the Scottish landscape), The child actors are simply stunning (their scenes with their Grandfather are beautiful) the script (apparently improvised at times sparkles with fun and creativity. How I recommend this film to anyone wanting a great trip to the cinema but please don't research it too much, watch out for spoilers and avoid them. Come to the film fresh as I did. Enjoy."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"I didn't know anything about this movie, but saw it on iTunes. I knew and liked most of the actors. So I rented it. I was sold within the first five minutes. And it didn't fail to get me more involved throughout. There's no big arc, great plot, fantastic action, or slap stick comedy. I mean, it's all there but not in a big, in your face way. And I love that. It's a story that anyone who has a heart, and has been through rough patches with his or her family can relate to. The script contains many really great lines, especially the kids' parts. It's masterful edited and well paced. There are a ton of short shots that create extra texture. Some stunning wide shots of the environment. Lots of use of indirect storytelling inducing your imagination, good acting, and incredible acting by the three kids. I was moved and welled up, laughed a lot, was in awe and progressively more engaged. If you're in the mood for action, big laughs, a thriller or a big drama, don't pick this one. But if you feel mellow and like good storytelling, then sit back, relax and watch this one."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"I was hesitant to go to see this, since the critics panned it (by and large). But absolutely no regrets."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"I have rarely seen a cinema full of people having so much fun. Great one liners, touching moments which still retain some authenticity despite a daft plot, and brilliant child actors."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"The three leads - Billy Connolly, Rosamund Pike and David Tennant - all turn in notable performances, but its the three children who are the most remarkable."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"There are also some nice positive life messages worked in, to take or leave as the viewer wishes."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,Not to be missed.
hat We Did on Our Holiday,This film is an utter delight. I went without having any idea what I was going to see and was utterly charmed by it.
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"Themes of love, separation, impending death and lies are dealt with in a sympathetic and thoroughly British way. The three male leads of Ben Miller, Billy Connolly and the luscious David Tennant excel at demonstrating dysfunction family life. The female leads are a little weaker, but still delver solid performances. The story focus around David Tennant and his estranged wife driving to Scotland for his fathers 75th birthday,knowing that he is dying and deciding because of his not to tell he truth about the impending divorce. ( this is all revealed in first 15 minutes so no spoiler) Sadly their separation has been none to amicable and their atrocious behaviour is impacting on each of their three children in different ways. In a similar way to Outnumbered the children appear to be largely unscripted which results in both some cringe worthy and some highly entertaining moments."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,Whilst this film is never going to light any fires it is a lovely way to while away a couple f hours. NB Please be aware this is a British made film and obtains a fair amount of swearing. Doesn't other me at all but it might some people.
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"Nice, sweet, heartfelt, family film. Beautiful cinematography & ending."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"A tale about a troubled parents (who are getting separated) and their three kids. The family travels to Scotland to celebrate the very ill grandfather's birthday. Before going there, the parents agreed with their kids to keep their separation secret from the grandfather, because they don't want to ruin his birthday party with such news. Then so many unexpected things happen at the celebration day."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"The performance was amazing especially the three kids, and the smart script makes you laugh at so many times despite the tragic story."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"The movie shows beautiful visuals of green Scotland, and the Scottish music was great."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,It is recommended for you if you wanted to watch something light and funny.
hat We Did on Our Holiday,This charming British film set in the beautifully scenic Scottish highlands had me gripped from the start.
hat We Did on Our Holiday,As a massive fan of writers Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin (Outnumbered) as well as actors David Tennant (Dr Who) and Rosamund Pike (Gone Girl) I had high hopes for this film and was not disappointed. There is so much heart and soul put into this film and delivers through its melancholic script and humour. With a cast full of award winning actors such as David Tennant and Rosamund Pike it is the children who steal the show. Their performances are detrimental to portraying the message of family and is done so with a childlike innocence as expected from screenwriters Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin of 'Outnumbered' fame.
hat We Did on Our Holiday,A great film that sent me through every emotion; and a perfect example of independent film at its finest.
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"Great British Television, superb acting especially from the 3 kids, normally in films kids are little shits and overpowering but these 3 you could watch all night, interesting when the nominations come out, these 3 put up truly great natural performances. Billy Connolly plays the part worthy of an Oscar. He plays a believable and predictable part, one you can expect of him in real life. The plot and the way it plays out will keep you in your seats. The Scottish Highlands play a magnificent part in the whole thing. Oh dear but that David Tennant don't you think he could have shaved first? I know male actors like to be ""with it"" but this unshaven appearance will soon go out of fashion and date a great film into this silly period of ""fashion"". I could go on more, but why bother, just watch it and you will be enthralled too."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,By far the best film I've seen for many months. One of the best ever in my book.
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"The writers did a fine job of mixing laughter and tears in among jokes about human frailty, farting and thrusting pumpkins."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"The locations chosen for the film are magnificent, stunningly beautiful, and evoke thoughts of escaping the rat race, and returning to the things that matter in life."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"The performances are absolutely perfect from each and every actor. The story line is touching and laden with humour. More than that though, it has a lesson for us all, about living life, enjoying those around us, and not parking too close to the sea. Wonderful."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"This film tells the story of a well known and rich, but erratic and dysfunctional family who gathers in Scotland for the grandfather's 75th birthday celebration."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"I am so delighted to have found this film, because it is probably the funniest film I have seen in months. The first third of the film made me laughed so hard that I could hardy breathe. The three kids are just being kids, but they are so funny in a really realistic way. The second half is quite sad, which is a drastic change of atmosphere. The third half becomes wildly funny again. You have to watch it to believe it. And the scenery is really beautiful as well. I thoroughly enjoyed watching ""What We Did on Our Holiday."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"This is, an excellent film, and certainly the best film I've been to see at the cinema in years. It's funny in places, hilarious in others. Like so much of Andy Hamilton's output, some of the comedy is subtle but it is exceedingly well constructed."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"The storyline is possible if not plausible, although the trailers don't really prepare you for the darker elements to the storyline. That said, my two primary school age kids loved the film and I think the 12A certification is a little excessive."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"The three children are fantastic and Billy Connolly excels in his role. Philosophical and smart, What We Did On Our Holiday is a shining example of great British comedy at its best."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"Great movie. First of, it brings twists and turns in the plot, or at least I really did not expect it to go in the direction it did. Therefore, I could say that the movie is ""alive"", it follows its own path and it does so sublimely.
So it went like this - we thought we are watching a comedy, then at some point we were glued to the screen, but someone asked ""Is this supposed to be a comedy, really?"". Then by the end we had cried and laughed and it all felt nicely and yet powerfully cathartic.
A good movie to watch when wondering what is life and living all about. And to remember that children are the future and the hope for healing the soul of humanity, so tired and entangled in its complicated problems nowadays.
No spoilers, just watch it. And wait for it..."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"Doug (David Tennant) and Abi McLeod (Rosamund Pike) are getting a divorce. They take a road trip with their young kids Lottie, Mickey, and Jess to attend his father Gordie (Billy Connolly)'s birthday party. They want to keep the split a secret. Gordie is also dying of cancer. His other son Gavin has jittery wife Margaret and emo teenager son Kenneth. Gavin is a wealthy fund manager and plans a big party. Gordie takes off for the beach with the three kids."
hat We Did on Our Holiday,"Most of all, the kids are adorable and they are great characters. There are some fun family dysfunctions and inappropriate subject matters. There is the big event which would be better later in the movie. The last act does try too hard to bring the family together. The story would flow better as a smaller family comedy without the media and a smaller police presence. That's not to say the last act doesn't have some good laughs and touching moments."
Straight Outta Compton,"First of all, I am a white man, 58 years old. opinions will always vary on quality of movies, but I am shocked at many of the comments/reviews I've seen for soc (straight outta Compton). To say one needs to know ebonics and ridiculous things such as that........is racist. I was shocked at how good the acting was. Oshea Jackson was the weak link in my opinion; but paul giamatti, and the guy who portrayed easy-e were amazing. I was prepared for a typical bio (especially music bios) where the story is way ahead of the acting. Guy playing dre was excellent as well. So I was pleasantly surprised. This is an outstanding movie. One need not have knowledge of the hip hop culture/industry, any more than one needs to know about southern America to watch and appreciate steel magnolias or fried green tomatoes (ok,, I'm dating myself here). I don't like the sound of u.s. southern accents, but that doesn't mean those flicks are not great. So please. To the point that many like to mention about the vulgarity: it was real life depiction! movies about 1600 England have a certain dialect. Same with this. people in different parts of the u.s. speak very differently. This should not be a drawback, but rather a very realistic telling of what happened. Open your minds, not everything is Ellen and Seinfeld. I have lived in l.a. since 1982 and I found it to be very interesting on many levels. Great writing, directing and acting. If it is very very odd for you, then perhaps you'll learn something watching it. I highly recommend this film."
Straight Outta Compton,"When reading other reviews about this movie, I really get frustrated due to the lack of understanding about what this movie is really about. A lot of empty reviews only giving 1 star due to ""explicit sexual content, and black men who does not respect the law""."
Straight Outta Compton,"What people does not seem to understand is that this is a movie about the rise, and fall of the biggest rap group ever, how they evolved and what power, money, and fame can to a man (and in this case, his relationship to his friends). As much as anything, this movie really is a lot about the abuse that a lot of black males experienced from the police in the 80's (which is still a very relevant topic)."
Straight Outta Compton,"Personally I am a big fan of N.W.A, without that being the reason I am rating this movie 9/10. It is a really interesting true story about some of THE great rap artists of our generation. Great performances by actors who looks a lot like the original group, as well as Paul Giamatti. Great directing, the movie has a really nice action curve, keeping things interesting throughout the movie, and really gives the public a good insight of the life of some of the biggest stars in the world during the 80's/90's."
Straight Outta Compton,"This is the first time i have ever written an review on IMDb, even though I have a lot of strong opinions about movies, but I really had to come to this movies defence. This is one of those movies I am really expecting to see a 8,3 star rating or something similar, and it really frustrates me to see a lot of people giving this movie unnecessary hate. GREAT MOVIE, if you like N.W.A, it is really worth your while, and if you are not, it is still worth a watch just because of the really intriguing true story that ""Straight Out Of Compton"" is."
Straight Outta Compton,9/10 movie
Straight Outta Compton,11/10 will watch again
Straight Outta Compton,"Even as a white kid from suburbia, I remember being exposed to the exhilarating and raucous sound of N.W.A. when I was four or five. My mother would play one of her brother's personally mixed CDs, filled with novelty songs, parodies, and vulgar rap songs I probably shouldn't have been heard at such a tender age, in car rides with me. Songs like ""Straight Outta Compton"" and ""F*** the Police"" were ingrained in my head, and I remember especially finding telling social relevance in the line, ""searchin' my car, lookin' for the product - thinking' every n**** is sellin' narcotics"" from the latter song despite being so young."
Straight Outta Compton,"I may not have ever experienced racial injustice in my life, but I was at least aware of racial double standards at a young age. With that, one of the purposes of F. Gary Gray's biopic on the acclaimed, pioneering rap group N.W.A. is to get us angry at the injustice that occurred in the 1980's and 1990's and remind us that this kind of hate still frighteningly occurs today. It hits us in the face and stomps on the audience hard, as if its strapped with brass knuckles and decked out in the latest Nikes, portraying the race relations in Los Angeles as they were - ugly and disgraceful."
Straight Outta Compton,"This portrayal only fits that of N.W.A.'s music and character. Comprised of five talented, street-smart young men, N.W.A. was a rap group predicated on detailing their harsh reality and controversial opinions in a brutally honest manner. Featuring the lyrical talents of Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson, Jr., son of Ice Cube and a spitting image of his father), Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins), and Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell), in addition to the lyrical and producing talents of MC Ren (Aldis Hodge) and DJ Yella (Neil Brown, Jr.), N.W.A. went from a Compton area bunch to a nationwide supergroup in what seemed to be overnight. Armed with the guidance of acclaimed music producer Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) and their desire to rap the truth and the strength of street knowledge, ""Straight Outta Compton"" details the rise of the group in addition to subsequent beefs, contract battles, and multiple tragedies that faced the talented young men in their prime."
Straight Outta Compton,"F. Gary Gray directs this film with complete conviction. He and writers Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff work to capture the major events in N.W.A. in a manner that, while all-encompassing, gets to the heart of each emotion and the significance of every conversation. Gray and company don't mess around in detailing the sure power and magnitude of this group through concerts, riots, and nationwide recognition, and they do so in a manner that's investing from the very first time the group is questioned by police for doing nothing wrong."
Straight Outta Compton,"""Straight Outta Compton,"" again, much like the music of N.W.A., hooks you with its bravado and swagger. We see the incredible charisma and charm of these five men, we hear their hard-hitting lyricism and their strong production, and we feel their simultaneous pride for their city and condemnation of its flaws, such as systemic racism and discrimination. From Gray's assured direction, it continues with the performances, all of which unanimously strong. Eazy-E was a character I wasn't really expecting to see developed as much as he was, but with the writing at hand and Jason Mitchell's emotionally potent and tender performance, he becomes the standout in a sea of great acting."
Straight Outta Compton,"Each actor brings something to the table here; Jackson, Jr.'s aggression is unmatched, particularly in a telling scene involving Priority Records, Hawkins is the conviction and the even-tempered soul through all this madness, Hodge is the wit and the sporadic humor of the group, and Brown, Jr. is the backup to all the characters in the film whenever they need it. Mitchell is the tender and enigmatic one, someone who isn't easily defined, has trouble rapping and performing occasionally, but someone who also comes with big ideas for the group he knows, loves, and wants to make huge. Finally, let's not forget Giamatti, in his second Oscar-worthy performance (first being in ""Love & Mercy"") of the year, who gives a performance just as emotionally investing and captivating as that of Mitchell's, particularly when the two are having a heart-to-heart."
Straight Outta Compton,"As entertainment, ""Straight Outta Compton,"" for this past summer, is unmatchable in its level of fun and human interest. As social commentary, despite being set a few decades back, the film is frighteningly current in its issues and its ideas. While it may follow some typical tropes of a biopic (the ""rise and fall"" structure), nonetheless, the sleekness and universal strength of everyone and everything in this project make it rise above those shortcomings into something truly worthwhile. Finally, as a piece of hip-hop history, and film in general, it's an indisputable must-see."
Straight Outta Compton,"This film documents the history of N.W.A. (N-word With Attitude) from before its inception in 1986 up until the death of Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) of aids. We see them as kids who ""want the best for me"" and reject society. They consider themselves journalist because they report on what is going on outside their door, expressing frustration in explicit and provoking language known as ""gangsta rap"". The film covers the splitting up of the group, the highlights and the low-lights. O'Shea Jackson Jr. did an excellent job playing Ice Cube, most likely better than Ice Cube could have done himself, if you have ever seen him act. The film made me wonder who was the most Ruthless, the rappers, the police, or the record company. They could have named this film ""Ruthless."" This is the story behind the lyrics. It was well done, but may not be topical for a lot of viewers."
Straight Outta Compton,"Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity. Bye Felicia."
Straight Outta Compton,"I never liked rap, I don't, and I never will."
Straight Outta Compton,"But as a metalhead, I liked the movie."
Straight Outta Compton,"""Straight Outta Compton"" has the similar taste of the other Music business,Wall Street business and the merchandise business movies which could easily satisfy and inspire the young audience to live their Katharsis of being a successful man or woman in the future, like the depicted successful people in these biographical genre movies. Because of theming this advantageous fact, usually these kinds of movies reaches the box office success in a short time (The Recent Example is The Wolf of Wall Street ). In addition to that, if you choose real biographic characters who live in ghettos and climbing the huge wall of the world's top in a while, definitely sell. Especially to young needy teenagers and young people eager to try everything to break the societies pressures and taboos."
Straight Outta Compton,"The expectation on the box office is important of course. ""Straight Outta Compton"" will possibly gain the success on box office.But some effectiveness' can make the audience feel uncomfortable about watching it again or remember it as their one of all time favorite classic. At least I will criticize the defectiveness that I have determined after I watched the movie until the end."
Straight Outta Compton,"The Subject of the biographic approach of Rap All-Stars is a perfect and unique idea. The originality can't be questioned. However the catharsis that I have mentioned before could not work for all cinema audience, I found the directing, acting and narration superficial.This was not the first biographical movie that has disappointed me with its narration and process of progression. And I think that won't be the last for sure.That's another argument.The main point is some biographies made by commercial concerns and cosmetic structure, harms them sometimes.This is the Rap Music's fathers' story,the action scenes could be more efficient on the contrary of matching some action b-movies, the classical and vigilant music agent profile played by Paul Giamatti, gave me the feeling of the same type which I ran across in other Music based movies.The actors who play the role of The Rap creators are good. The lack of the Katharsis begins with their shallow depiction, so that I definitely think that Dre or Ice Cube or Eazy E's lives depiction with other characters and crowded casting had created that mess and caused the defectiveness. Because almost 2 and a half hour movie isn't enough to depict the whole family of rap's beginning and the depiction of separate lives of them could make a better order in the narration. Linked to that criticism of the shallow narration, the documentary trace additions which would be a good idea on a biographical Movie, was used ineffectively in my opinion. For Example The Rap's born documentary series on VH1 would be watchable for all kinds of documentary lovers, so I believe that in the movie this magazine coverage documentary style is used by showing the social struggles of the Rapper's since their youth, the police's tough attitudes to the Black Citizens in their Neighbourhoods and putting the actual footage of the fights and plundering in the ghettos. However the idea of Half magazine and half crime narrated documentary style using in a movie, is very hard job and I realized that some parts were good adopted from this kind of E! or VH1 documentaries but some parts seemed weak because of several things that make the distinction between Documentary Movie and Cinema Movie, which would cause dead ends on the narration of Cinema Movie."
Straight Outta Compton,"For instance the lack of voice narration as a result of the director's obligation of staying out of magazine words, the time-lapse difference between a documentary and a movie,the slow timing usage to tell the story in the movie on the contrary of a rushing biographical documentary and doing it with telling the audience the story of at least 5-6 rap stars in such a slow occasion, had killed the spirit of the ""Magazine-Documentary- Biography"" triplet style depiction. But I still believe that ""Straight Outta Compton"" could easily be the first and unique example of the future styles of direction and maybe could create a new unique genre as well."
Straight Outta Compton,"Everyone one here who complains about the movie don't know what they're talking about. This movie is reality! Police brutality, growing up in the hood, the extravagant lifestyle of singers/rappers is all there. Someone complained about this being vulgar and not appropriate for kids? No duh, it's rated R. Even though it was a long movie, I didn't want it to end. You really felt what was going on in the movie. When they were angry, you were angry. When they were sad, you couldn't help but to feel that as well. Don't listen to the people complaining, and calling them ""selfish"". They're probably just upset at how the police were portrayed, which was the reality for N.W.A. The movie is amazing. Watch it. This movie was extremely enjoyable, and despite the length, it felt like it went by in the blink of an eye."
Straight Outta Compton,"Straight Outta Compton tells the the story of the most influential group in hip-hop and rap, that group being N.W.A or as Eazy-E so gracefully puts it N****s With Attitudes. Directed by F. Gary Gray, Straight Outta Compton is, without a doubt, his best work behind the camera. However, by traditional standards, that isn't saying much. Gray is no stranger to N.W.A, Ice Cube or Dr. Dre having directed numerous music videos featuring their music. While the film is a very nice ""fairy tale"" telling of a story filled with tension, violence and rage, it lacks the balls to tell the actual story. Instead, the film picks and chooses what to tell and what to leave out, very strategically as well considering the film is two and a half hours plus. Starting with the streets of Compton, we are introduced to each character with a bang. Each of them getting their own introduction as if they were folk heroes or something, whether it is petty crime or writing rap lyrics, the film shows these characters with a sense of heroism to them no matter what they're doing. The best performance out of the group would have to be Corey Hawkins as Dr. Dre. Hawkins delivers in every scene he's in, making it a true standout performance among actors that sometimes feel like they're in over their heads, more specifically Jason Mitchell, who plays Eazy-E. Mitchell feels more like a caricature of the late rapper rather than an actual actor portraying a real life counterpart. The film moves quickly enough and focuses long and hard on all of the partying, the women, the guns and the drugs, so much so that you start to wonder whether the film is a N.W.A music video tribute. Despite the falsehoods, the glorification and the shaky performances, Straight Outta Compton works well as an entertaining film. The only downside of this film is its haphazard statement on Police Brutality. While that is as prevalent as a topic can get for a film from 2015 about N.W.A, that was not the highlight of the group. The highlight of the group was the fight against the censors. A fight that they won, obviously. Despite that truth, the film wallows in trying to be a message about police brutality rather than a film about these men, their flaws and their triumphs, their ups and their downs. Unfortunately, it leaves us knowing nothing new about these people and at two and a half hours, we should leave this film knowing every little detail about them. Instead, we're left wanting more out of them. Overall, Straight Outta Compton ends up being an entertaining film about some of America's favorite rap artists instead of an important one."
Straight Outta Compton,"When I saw the film was going to be well over two hours, I will admit I thought they were too overzealous, but every minute of this movie was entertaining."
Straight Outta Compton,"The fact that a movie that tells the history of hip hop's most infamous group, and is on the level of such biopics as Oliver Stone's The Doors just shows you were hip hop has gone since the beginning of NWA."
Straight Outta Compton,"Usually biopics like this get boring when the third act hits, but not Straight out of Compton. It keeps your heart pumping to the very last minute."
Straight Outta Compton,"He's not gonna go down in history as the world's greatest thespian but you could do no wrong with Ice Cube Jr. Mimicking daddy-o (Ice Cube's son plays his dad and looks just like him). He had it down, but so did the kid playing Easy E, but the real credit goes to F. Gary Gray who made music videos for members of NWA. The writers and producers which included Ice cube also contributed to how entertaining this movie was. It feels like everyone cared about the project."
Straight Outta Compton,"Straight out of Compton is a positive spin on the NWA story, showing how five guys from the neighborhood who only wanted to make music for the kids on their block ended up taking over the world. It's has this ""this could be you"" vibe and overall is an uplifting story about living your dreams on your terms. It's no different than any other rock star's story and that's one of the reasons it's amazing."
Straight Outta Compton,"Also like how the story gave equal time to members DJ Yella and MC Ren. I was expecting the Big three players in the band to overshadow them, but the film treated these two with respect."
Straight Outta Compton,What a great story. It was totally worthy of the 2 hours and 42 mins spent in the theater. Every minute counted.
Straight Outta Compton,I'm thinking good enough to get nominated for something in awards season.
Straight Outta Compton,"This is a movie which will grip you even if you're not a big fan of rap pioneers NWA, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Snoop Dogg. If you are a fan, you'll probably be in heaven. Either way, I highly recommend this movie, which has it all: great acting, a compelling story, riveting direction, and most importantly, honesty."
Straight Outta Compton,"It doesn't make excuses, but at the same time, you see the genesis for NWA's incendiary lyrics: blatant racism and brutality by the LAPD at the direction of Daryl Gates, vast economic disparity relative to other citizens of LA, and an environment of gang violence. Can you imagine being held at gunpoint by thugs entering your school bus because you had made a few gestures at them out your window? Being forced to the ground with hands behind your back by the police for no other reason than the color of your skin?"
Straight Outta Compton,"You also see NWA's defense so eloquently put by Ice Cube (well, his son, O'Shea Jackson, Jr., who plays him brilliantly): they were simply reflecting their world, honestly, and were also protected by the First Amendment. There isn't a lot of visibility put into the misogynistic lyrics of the genre and these artists, but it is clear that they were young men acting out, and when we see the older Cube a family man, sagely reflecting back on a video he made was younger, we appreciate that. We tend to have barriers and stereotypes built up, demonizing others we don't understand particularly when they confront and challenge the status quo, and this movie really helps break those down. At the same time, the attitude and actions against women were the areas that I felt the artists got too much of a pass, and a perfectly honest movie would have included those elements."
Straight Outta Compton,"I liked seeing all of the personalities in what was a very special time in music history, similar to when McCartney met Lennon or Jagger met Richards. Fans of those bands, calm down, I'm not suggesting NWA reached the heights of the Beatles or Stones, but what an incredible influence they had on an entire genre from the crucible that was Compton in the 80's. You see the fiery lyrics of Ice Cube, the visionary genius of Dr. Dre, and the tragic story of Eazy-E. Corey Hawkins plays Dre and Jason Mitchell plays Eazy-E, and both are fantastic. You see great nuance in the character of the band's manager Paul Heller, played by Paul Giamatti, who advocates for them and advances them, but also ultimately screws them. You see the jealousies between the band members lead to a schism. You see Snoop Dogg (Keith Stanfield) arrive on the scene, and you see a real villain in Suge Knight (R. Marcos Taylor), who at first seems to be helping them get out of a situation in which they're being taken advantage of, but quickly does that himself, and in addition, exercise extreme violence in asserting his power. The quality of the acting is consistently high. The story itself is fascinating, and Director F. Gary Gray did a great job of figuring out what to leave in and what to leave out. Even though it's 147 minutes, which is long, you'll find it flies by and doesn't seem long, which is the sign of a great story-teller. It's quite surprising that none of these fine actors, the director, or the movie itself were even nominated for an Oscar, and quite right that that fact was widely protested. Definitely go see this movie."
Straight Outta Compton,The most entertaining thing about this movie for me wasn't actually in the movie. It was the clever memes people put onto Facebook. Mine was: Straight Outta My Mom.
Straight Outta Compton,"Sure, I grew up in the 1980s and 1990s and knew of these artists, but they were never my bag. Never been a rap fan, so I knew very little of their history here. Make that, I knew almost nothing going in, so all of this was interesting from an outsider's POV. That said, my suspicions were correct: There were no good people here. Everyone was pretty much an asshole and contained very little moral ground to cling to."
Straight Outta Compton,"I did, however, agree with their rights to the First Amendment and completely disagreed with those who fought against their privilege to use their talents to convey their messages."
Straight Outta Compton,"The movie, while well-made, is just another run-of-the-mill music biopic. Inspiring artists with no one to back them and more telling them not to continue, finally make it. This comes with costs, tensions, jealousy, contract disputes, make-ups, etc., etc."
Straight Outta Compton,"Mercifully, and delving into spoiler territory, the movie redeems the real-life characters, but sadly by the time the Lifetime Movie moment happens, I've all-but dismissed everyone as bad people."
Straight Outta Compton,"Hell, even when they try and do the right thing, they give their opposition freedom to rightfully slam them."
Straight Outta Compton,"Again, the movie was competently made, interesting and definitely well-acted. Didn't turn me into any fan of rap, or the N.W.A., but it was worth a watch."
Straight Outta Compton,***
Straight Outta Compton,"Final thoughts: Either I saw the reader's digest version, or they're not telling the whole story, but it sucks on how much violence they threatened and caused and got away with it. All the way through this, I only stayed in their corner for their First Amendment rights. All the other sh<>t they pulled, welllive by the sword"
Straight Outta Compton,First i have to confess that before watching this i didn't have a clue who NWA was. The Hip Hip / Rap scene passed me by or more accurately i avoided it because i really can't stand rap. F. Gary Gray lazily presumes the audience is already familiar with these people and that annoyed me. I did not have a clue who the members of NWA were and i think that put me at a massive disadvantage when watching this film. The characters aren't the most likable of people. They seemed to spend the majority of the film scowling and arguing about money rather than making music and it this grated on me ( but not as much as the music) . Only in the last half an hour of the film do we actually see any form of compassion or humanity from the band members . It wasn't until the film showed a few real film footage clips near the end did i realise how well they did with the casting as the actors as they really do look like the real artists. Sadly that wasn't enough for me to like this film but i'm sure fans of NWA would totally disagree.
Straight Outta Compton,"""Straight Outta Compton"" is one of the most talked about films from this year and it gives us an insight into the rise and fall of the successful hip-hop posse NWA. And even if I am not too interested in rap music, I cannot deny having heard of some of the main characters such as Suge Knight and Dr. Dre of course. Maybe my lack of interest in this film is because I have not lived back then yet or wasn't old enough to follow these significant years in hip-hop history. The director is F. Gary Gray and you may have seen his ""Law Abiding Citizen"". Another problem I had with Compton is that it just felt too long for its own good. There was nothing really refreshing in here, pretty much everything expected, such as the guys' struggles with (predominantly White) policemen, authority arguments with other black people living in the hood etc. Oscar nominee Paul Giamatti may be the most known name in the cast here playing a prominent record company boss and even if he is good as usual, he cannot make this film a memorable watch either."
Straight Outta Compton,"This movie runs for almost 2.5 hours, which is definitely way too long. They just did not have the material to make this an exciting watch for such a long time. 100 minutes would have been more than enough. There are occasionally interesting references about the 1980s such as near the end people thinking the HIV virus would only be transmitted through gay sex, but also this area is not enough and could have been much more than it actually turned out to be. I think this film is only a good watch for people who are already hugely interested in rap music before watching. This is no film that will spark an interest for anybody who doesn't really care about hip-hop. Surprised this one has received such favorable critical reception. Not recommended."
Straight Outta Compton,"I know very little about rap and even less about it's history so I found the film to be fascinating. But every Biopic that gets acclaim that draws my interest, I always will be curious how much of it is true and what underlying messages got twisted to illustrate a different narrative. And the biggest one is the portrayal of Dr. Dre."
Straight Outta Compton,My impression of him was that he was that he was the quietest and the most sensible member of the group that had the least problems with the law. But what the film neglects to show is all of the abuse that Dr. Dre did towards women. It's important to remember when watching Biopics to see who is involved in the production of the films and who comes out as the winners in the story to find out how factual that they really are.
Straight Outta Compton,"It was an interesting and well-made film with lots of truths that are mixed up due to the inputs coming from a bunch of different people with Eazy-E obviously not one of them due to his unfortunate death to AIDS in 1995. As always, movies like this tend to paint the people involved in a more positive light than they deserve to be, but I enjoyed the film nonetheless."
Straight Outta Compton,"I was reading some of the reviews about this amazing movie and wanted to laugh. ""Oh my gosh, it has sex, drugs and violence. Boo hoo!"" I mean, do people do any kind of research before shelling out their $10? This movie takes place in Compton in the mid 80s. This wasn't Mr. Rogers Neighborhood, this was a rough, hardcore area where blacks didn't know if they would be arrested and assaulted by cops or shot at by gangsters anytime they stepped out the door. ""Straight Outta Compton"" is one of the most remarkable rags to riches stories about a group that changes the face to music, movies and pop culture on a grander scale."
Straight Outta Compton,"The movies introduces us to the five members of N.W.A.: Ice Cube, Easy-E, Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, and MC Ren. We see how the group formed, how they met manager Jerry Heller, the recording of their first album, the flack they received on tours, their constant battle over censorship and freedom of speech, their lives of excess and partying, the trouble they experienced by law enforcement for just standing there, the battle of egos, inner band turmoil, and eventually the splitting up of the group. If you are a fan of hip hop, you know how much of an influence N.W.A. had to the rise of West Coast Hip Hop and Gangsta Rap. At this time, the only real way to hear new music was the radio, and due to their controversial lyrics, they never got any airplay, but the media helped create buzz and popularity almost indadvertedly by talking about how controversial the group was and how people didn't like their music. That resulted in the band becoming multi-platinum superstars. In fact, the band didn't just grab the black audience, but was highly popular with white men, who started turning away from rock music, which was facing a decline due to cheesy hair metal production, to this new, powerful, anti-establishment credo that rock once represented. Yes, there is drug use, sex and violence, but this was the life these guys knew, and no matter how far you go, you never forget your roots or completely leave them."
Straight Outta Compton,"The actors all do an excellent job in their roles. The only real veteran in this film is Paul Giamatti, who does his usual solid performance, this time as the sleazy, manipulative manager Jerry Heller. Interestingly enough, Giamatti was in another music biopic this year, Love and Mercy, about another influential Southern California band (The Beach Boys). Both bands, very much from the same area, had such a influence to their periods of time and represented completely different worlds of Southern California youth life."
Straight Outta Compton,"Even if you're not a fan of hip-hop, I still think you need to this as their effect on pop culture in general is still prevalent today. Also, on a sadder note, the issues of police brutality on minorities still is a glaring problem that makes F the Police sound just as fresh as it did in 1988."
Straight Outta Compton,"Whether you'd like Straight Outta Compton depends on how you like hip hop. However, if you're a NWA fan you probably know all there is to know about the events depicted in the movie."
Straight Outta Compton,"With Dr. Dre and Ice Cube among producers i can assume that the facts are slightly skewed. But even this notion, and i admit it is slightly below the line, doesn't influence the big picture. This is one fine biopic."
Straight Outta Compton,"The rest is really your opinion. If you're into hip hop, this is one of those movies that would be a candidate for the Holy Grail. My opinion, though, is implied by my vote..."
Straight Outta Compton,"The resemblance of the actors to the real-life NWA members is amazing, although i didn't expect less from O'Shea Jackson Jr. for obvious reasons."
Straight Outta Compton,"My strongest impression, though, is how biopics such as Straight Outta Compton influence my opinion about the protagonists. I like to call it ""Wikpedia's drawback"". In this particular case, i've listened to NWA and later mostly Dr. Dre and formed my opinion both about the authors and their output. This is some kind of idealized picture. But when you read on Wikipedia or see a biopic and realize how it all really happened it always gives me a whole new insight. And such insights are not always positive."
Straight Outta Compton,"Yet again, this is all just my opinion."
Straight Outta Compton,"I didn't have high expectations for this but I knew the characters portrayed and was interested in their history. Unfortunately, the acting is poor and the direction appears to have no purpose. The music has not stood the test of time and is now dull, repetitious and tries far too hard. It is amazing to look back and believe that these people and their ""music"" became popular at all. Rap lacks any real innovation and doesn't seem to have progressed very far since the 1980s. It needs to steer away from the violence and misogyny that it popularizes and I wonder why women don't complain out loudly about this."
Straight Outta Compton,The actual story is so stereotypical and formulaic that it became tedious to watch very early on and made it difficult to stay interested. After watching I cannot believe the high rating the film has here and I can only put it down to some earnest fans and their friends voting for the music rather than the story.
Straight Outta Compton,"I'm a hip-hop head and grew up in the NWA era, even if I wasn't a hip-hop junkie I don't think I would love this movie any less. When I first saw the trailer I wasn't quite sold. The movie was wonderful. I cannot find too many things I didn't like about it. If I were too nitpick, then I would say they painted Dre & Ice Cube too positively. I'm pretty sure there were less flattering things about them. But judging this from just how well it was written, acted and directed, I would have to say this was flawless."
Straight Outta Compton,"Obviously there are five members of the group, and the film chose to focus more on the three most popular members, which I did not have a problem with. Because the movie was carried out so well, it did not affect the overall story of the group as a whole. What made this so wonderful for me is that almost every pivotal scene in the movie, I remember being a part of it, because I remember where I was when each moment was happening. When certain songs were shown being made or when the tragic news of Eazy-E was reported. It took me down memory lane of my own life, not too many films can do this."
Straight Outta Compton,"And the music of course is a major part of the story and it was well executed. Now let's talk about the cast. What a well-put together cast! This movie had humor, tragedy and everything in between. It was sold by this wonderful cast. Basically Ice Cube's son O'Shea Jackson was born to play this role, literally and he knocked it out the park. But the two that held this glue together was Paul Giamatti playing Jerry Heller and Jason Mitchell as Eazy-E. The chemistry between those two was amazing. I would love to see someone from this cast get an Academy Award nomination. In my opinion, this is a great contender for Best Film for the Oscars."
Straight Outta Compton,"As a hip-hop junkie and a lover of great films, I would like to say thank you to the creators of this movie for reminding me why I love Hip-Hop so much."
Straight Outta Compton,"I try to make it quick this time. Watch this movie. It is easily one of the best I have seen in a long time and I was skeptical with all the praise it got beforehand. But it is well deserved. The three lead actors are amazing as well as the direction. Yes you see them ""fight"" the police but this is not a political film. This is a drama."
Straight Outta Compton,"It is about friendship, about self-fulfillment, about creating something and about how greed destroys everything. It has been a long time that I sat in a movie theater and you could feel how much respect and love everybody in the audience has for this film. You don't need to love HipHop to enjoy this incredible movie."
Straight Outta Compton,"OMG! I never go into movies with high expectations, but this one I did, and I'm glad I did because it completely MATCHED my high expectations! The story was beautifully told, casting and portrayals on POINT! The actors made me feel laughter, sadness and anger! I left out of that theater proud."
Straight Outta Compton,"I will be taking my parents to go see this with me so they can know the people I was born into listening to. They only watch them now on commercials and love watching them in movies, but never knew their background on where they came from and how they got started. They always took me to go see history so I figure I will return the favor and take them to see some of mine. The crazy part is, the story that's told is STILL relevant to what is going on today."
Straight Outta Compton,Amazing job. I have nothing bad to say about this story at all. Simply incredible. 10 points!
Straight Outta Compton,"I have a problem with the clothing and the script.I am always very sensitive to when the slang or clothing are misplaced in an era.Young black men didn't say ah-IE back then. Lots of baseball caps and over-sized t-shirts as well.The word alright sounded more like alright back in those days. Black urban youths started saying ah-IE pretty recently.Perhaps no longer than 10 years ago.In fact they didn't ask ""what-up""? either.They didn't use the N word as much however did in fact refer to each other as blood or sometimes even dog. It would have been a pretty good production they just gotten their 80's script down (by law).I am.When it comes to black cinema I am fairly sure I know what's good and genuine.The police use of unnecessary force and the N word are induced to prove the peril of Compton at the time. Colors portrayed it with more realism and I have to give this an overall low rating for being too contrived an poorly researched.I know i'll get my honky s whooped now and have to lick it up but word."
Straight Outta Compton,"Music biopics are one of my favorite genres of film. I love seeing a musical artist or band portrayed on screen and their rise to fame, complete with how they came up with their platinum hits, warts and all. As of lately, we haven't seen a ton of these biopics with the exception of the excellent 'Love & Mercy' about Beach Boys member Brian Wilson. Most of the biopics usually focus on one person or a band and go up until they hit it big, but that's not the case with 'Straight Outta Compton', which is more of a bio-epic than a biopic. Instead of following one person, the film follows three main characters with a treasure trove of other superstar artists."
Straight Outta Compton,"The three in question are Andre Young, O'Shea Jackson, and Eric Wright or Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Eazy-E respectively as they form one of the world's greatest rap groups in the late 80s - 'N.W.A.'. Director F. Gary Gray ('Friday'), has perfectly strewn together several characters and told their stories through several years, highlighting the good times as well as the bad of these three amazing artists. If you grew up like I did in the 80's and 90's, 'N.W.A.' was a huge deal. Not only was their music and lyrics incredible and powerful, but they spoke the truth about was going down in their violent neighborhoods as well as how the racist and trigger happy L.A.P.D. would treat them and their fellow neighbors."
Straight Outta Compton,"Nothing like that had been done before and caused a revolution of sorts as it gave the people a voice to stand up against the unfair and unjust law enforcement, as well as shed light onto what was going on the in these certain neighborhoods on a daily basis. Dre (Corey Hawkins) and Ice Cube (Ice Cube's son O'Shea Jackson Jr.) were already creating beats and rapping about the streets at local rollerskating rinks and other parties in town to get by, and people were taking a keen liking to the new style of rap. It was then that they asked their drug-dealer friend Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) to front the money to cut single, which would become 'Boyz n the Hood', as Dre made the music, Cube wrote the lyrics, and Eazy sang."
Straight Outta Compton,"It didn't all come easily either as we see in a humorous scene where they finally talk Eazy into getting on the microphone, and realize he sounds awful, that is until Dre gives him some advice and direction, to which we hear those iconic lyrics, ""Cruisin' down the street in my 64"". This film is made up of moments like this, and it's so much fun to see how these amazing artists came up with it. After the 'Boyz n the Hood' single was released on Eazy's Ruthless Records, Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti), a music manager comes after Eazy and tells him her can bring him to the top of the music game. All seems kosher and right with Jerry at first, but he's focused on Eazy rather than anyone else in the group, leaving Dre, Ice Cube, MC Ren, and DJ Yella without pay or claim to their contributions to their first record 'Straight Outta Compton'."
Straight Outta Compton,"As we go through these guy's careers, we also see their vulnerable side, as they struggle with fame, death, law enforcement, and even the federal government who try to cease and censor their music. We even see the origin of their famous song 'F*ck the Police', after several repugnant L.A. police officers force these guys to the ground outside their music studio for doing literally nothing, which is something these musicians have witnessed and been privy to many times before. We also get glimpses of how TuPac, Snoop Dogg, Warren G, and Suge Knight came into play as well, with their usual claims to fame, whether it be how Snoop and Dre created ""Nuthin' But a ""G"" Thang"", Dre showing 'California Love' to TuPac, or Suge Knight showing his true violent colors."
Straight Outta Compton,"It's all well directed and executed in a manner that you'd always hoped it would, which respects these artists. The film spans quite a few years and gives each person enough time to relate and sympathize with, which is key in this story and Gray shows each sequence, emotional moment, and concert flawlessly. The actors here are perfect as well, and all show some great promise in their future careers. Each performance was spot on and very believable, pulling out each emotion perfectly. You might even muster tears at certain points from these great performances."
Straight Outta Compton,"Not only that, these guys look so much like the real-life people they're portraying that I forgot I was watching different actors several times throughout. Their facial expressions and mannerisms are spot on. And of course, Paul Giamatti plays the asshole business manager/agent very well, just like he's played in several other films in his recent career. Then of course there is the music, which is chock full of the greatest rap hits from this time period. You'll find yourself moving to the beat with each song. It's hypnotic in a way."
Straight Outta Compton,"'Straight Outta Compton' is one music bio-epic you can't miss. It's an incredible film that is executed exquisitely, and not only that, it's an important film, that showcases some of the violence of law enforcement that is going on today. This is a must-see."
Straight Outta Compton,HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION AND MUST SEE!
Straight Outta Compton,"I'll come clean and say that I generally liked this film because I love hip hop; particularly from the late 80's through to the late 90's. I was interested in the character portrayal, the music was great and as a hip hop fan it was interesting."
Straight Outta Compton,However ...
Straight Outta Compton,"Honestly, as a film it was pretty bad really. The acting is terrible, it's an hour too long and I find it a bit weird that Cube and Dre are bigging themselves up massively and they are the producers. I can't imagine that anyone that does not like hip hop would even begin to like this film in the slightest. It's very boring towards the end and it's just a series of really weird scenes all cut together."
Straight Outta Compton,"I'm not sure why it's doing so well with the critics, but I expect that the timing is great with Dre's new album and the Apple Music stuff. Either way, if you like hip hop you'll like this for a lot of reasons. If you don't, this is likely to be the worse film you'll ever see!"
Straight Outta Compton,"...I had to watch the movie since I actually liked at the time some of the music of NWA, especially the title track of the movie. Yet what happened after-wards, after their success, is just a sell out to make a bunch of money with no more attitude than all the others."
Straight Outta Compton,"And now the movie and it would deserve just one star, yet the music brings back some memories when things could have been changed in a different way than they wanted to. Look at them now, nowadays...thats all that there is to say about the characters of the movie."
Straight Outta Compton,"The acting is typical for the gang banging crowds nowadays and so it can be seen on every street-corner in major cities and is nothing special and that I mean not in a good way. If that was meant to change things, well Sirs, screw you! The story itself, well I do not know what is true and what is not, but like stated above, in the end it came to make more money than others. What they have changed is just that violence and negativity can bring success, that youths of today look up to them what they could do and want to do as well...THAT is what they have changed and just because Compton is nowadays almost everywhere, does not make this a success in changes, but a success in stupidity. And so it does not matter to me if you become legit than after-wards and make movies about your awful youth and how you can succeed and then make funny movies, like Ice Cube...."
Straight Outta Compton,"So what remains is the music...there was once a dream of a few guys who wanted to change something, what they have changed is to have today an attitude, which became wide spread, for the big buck. Nothing wrong with it, yet don't be surprised when you get now the attitude that you spread and so...please straight BACK to Compton and please try again!"
Straight Outta Compton,"For former NWA fans a must, for people who love the attitude nowadays a must, for normalos who aren't impressed but rather appalled by the success of a negative attitude and the real change they created, a no show!"
Ted 2,"Ted 2 now focuses on the titular anthropomorphic teddy bear in, having his own life of marriage and plans ahead of getting a non-biological child. This leads to a strangely interesting conflict about gaining civil rights to a teddy bear. And it's stranger that at some point the movie does take it somewhat seriously, and eventually goes back to its crass hijinks. It's nice, but nothing much compelling in the end, because what obviously overshadows it is definitely the outrageous laughs. But even the degree of laughs suffers the same problem; it's full of energy at first then it awkwardly mutes its lighter tone for its climax. Fans of the first may get the same pleasure that they seek, but there is really nothing special to it, either."
Ted 2,"The first half really has the strongest amount of funny moments and also brought some intrigue to the story's center. But the movie apparently cannot decide what exact approach it is generally taking. The outrageous comedy is still everywhere, but whenever it stops by focusing on its themes, it really takes it seriously, like it actually believes that it is saying something important. But the movie hardly earns anything to deserve that attention. It's just shifting from its outrageous nature to a sudden gravity back and forth. Even for a comedy that is actually just fooling around, it stills displays a mind of uncertainty. There is also some bits of attempting to replicate Broadway; with dance numbers and a song. Can't tell if that's one of the movie's way of tripping or the director just wants to show off that he can do a musical. Either way, it rather feels nothing more than a random filler. The movie is also a little too long, the movie hitting the same major problem of the first film by setting up a climax that it's supposed to drive tension. It never felt right for the film, even worse, it's more like a rehash, reintroducing the same villain except it takes place in a different location. It's rather awkward and tedious than effective."
Ted 2,"The sentiment doesn't felt convincing enough for the movie's true colors, but then it's all about the humor. And if the humor works, then there is a worthy roar of laughter to get from this film. Predictably raunchy, pot fueled and consists pop culture references; that will certainly be enjoyed if you understand the language of a Seth MacFarlane comedy. It's fun if it really tries to be fun. The performances from its lead actors are still a joy to watch. MacFarlane still manages to put energy to the talking teddy bear and Mark Wahlberg is still committed to fool around as Ted's man child best friend."
Ted 2,"Ted 2 doesn't bring the same surprise of the first one, but if you're in for more outrageous laughs from this profane talking teddy bear, then it won't be a problem, as long as you're not expecting too much. The film does try to bring on an important theme, but it's not as effective or as strong as it wanted to be; it does make some interesting arguments, just doesn't have any powerful or at least earned conclusion to it; but hell, who would exactly take that seriously, anyway? Well, no more than the movie itself. It should have been shorter, the storyline should have been tighter, and the third act should have tried harder than repeating its predecessor. Again, it can be really funny, it just suffers handling its ideas better."
Ted 2,His certainly not a cuddly teddy that's for all but after one seriously successful first outing in 2012 it was always a given that everyone's (the only one?) favourite foul mouthed yet somehow endearing talking bear was going to make it back to a big screen close by and with that we now have Ted 2.
Ted 2,"After his biggest misfire yet in the potentially hilarious yet wrongly skewed A Million Ways to Die in the West (of which an alumni of makes a great cameo in this film), Seth MacFarlane finds himself back on familiar ground, which is in both a material sense, a comedic sense and also a still unfortunately self-indulgent directional sense that see's MacFarlane struggle to rid his 2 hour plus film of jokes that don't work and plot lines that feel like nothing more than time fillers. If there was ever a director in need of someone to cull his films of material that neither enhance or contribute to the tale at hand it's MacFarlane but to say the man doesn't deliver some comedic gold in this enjoyable romp would be a lie."
Ted 2,"While you'll often find yourself ashamed at what brings forth fits of laughter here, MacFarlane as he is well known to do, mixes juvenile humour with far more wide reaching topical funnies, from everything from civil rights through to his usual pop culture insights, nothing is out of his reach. Within the films bloated runtime there are moments of pure gold that make Ted 2 succeed to the level it does, much like its predecessor and with the continued chemistry shared between Whalberg's well-meaning yet daft John and the MacFarlane voiced Ted Clubber-Lang (yes Ted now has a last name) at the same high levels the films many sins can be forgiven thanks to their often game saving banters. The addition of Amanda Seyfried is also a bonus to the film, her willingness to poke fun at herself a particular highlight."
Ted 2,The narrative of Ted 2 is anything but fantastic and the reappearance of Giovani Ribisi's teddy obsessed villain Donny is almost a movie breaker but Ted 2 has enough wit and chemistry to save itself from all the low denominator humour and awkwardly edited grove that surrounds it and in the end provides some very decent comedic entertainment. In saying this it may be time for all involved to move onto other things with MacFarlane in particular in need of something a little meatier than he has been dishing up over the last few years.
Ted 2,3 Tom Brady home invasions out of 5
Ted 2,"Living teddy bear, Ted (Seth MacFarlane) has finally married his girlfriend Tami-Lynn McCafferty (Jessica Barth) with his friend John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) as his best man having been divorced from Lori for six months. About a year after the wedding Tami-Lynn and Ted start experiencing marital difficulties and on the advice of a friend Ted floats the idea of adopting a child with Tami-Lynn who's receptive to the idea. After learning Tami-Lynn is infertile due to years of drug use, the two decide to go the adoption route which not only fails, but leads to several chain reactions in Ted's life as he's technically ""property"" and not a person according to the state. The two enlist the help of a local law firm and are given recent Law School grad Samantha Jackson (Amanda Seyfried) who hits it off with John. Meanwhile, Ted's stalker Donny (Giovanni Ribisi) is now working at Hasbro as a janitor and convinces Hasbro's CEO Tom Jessup (John Carroll Lynch) to bank roll the opposition to Ted's case in the hopes of making Ted's rights forfeit and mass producing duplicates so Donny can finally have one of his own."
Ted 2,"2012's Ted was indisputably the year's biggest comedy release of that year making $550 million against a $65 million budget and allowing writer director Seth MacFarlane to stretch his success beyond his prime time animated shows like Family Guy and American Dad to other areas including his revival of Cosmos and eventually his Star Trek homage The Orville. With Ted being a success, it was pretty much a given that there'd be a sequel which MacFarlane commenced following the disappointing returns on his western comedy A Million Ways to Die in the West. Initially written as a road trip comedy where in Ted and John would smuggle a load of marijuana across the United States, the premise was scrapped early on due to similarities with the 2013 comedy We're the Millers. Eventually the focus shifted to one of Ted proving himself as a person under the eyes of the law, necessitating the inclusion of a lawyer character and writing out Mila Kunis' character Lori from the last movie. When the movie was released in June 2015, its grosses fell short of its processor making $120 million less domestically at $81 million but thanks to the international market it did eventually manage to get to $216 million worldwide. MacFarlane hasn't directed another film since Ted 2 but did direct some episodes of The Orville that are reasonably well regarded so there hasn't been any adverse fallout from its underperformance. The movie itself, it's basically just more of the same minus the freshness and the recurring issues that plague most comedy sequels."
Ted 2,"Ted 2 begins fairly okay within the first 20 minutes as it opens with a humorous wedding for Ted and Tami-Lynn and transitions into a Busby Berkeley-esque musical number that serves as out opening credits. But then we have the other things, like John now divorced from Lori effectively undoing any of his character development and resetting him to square one (never a good sign for a comedy sequel). On top of the issues with sequelitis we also have many sequences that are lifted wholesale from episodes of Family Guy such as the sperm spilling scene from the episode Sibling Rivalry and even the main plot follows many of the major beats of the series seventh episode Brian: Portrait of a Dog where in a talking dog fought a legal battle for his civil rights. And when it's not copying scenes from Family Guy, it's copying scenes from other comedies like the ""Mess Around"" driving sequence from Planes, Trains, and Automobiles."
Ted 2,"I know Family Guy has a history of wholesale lifting sequences, dialogue, and set pieces from other TV shows and movies and just placing their own characters in it, and considering it's a 22 minute TV episode with commercials it is what it is. But a movie doesn't follow the same rules as TV and when you recycle jokes your and setups your audience saw on TV for free and now make them pay theater prices to see them on the big screen it shows a remarkable amount of contempt for your audience. MacFarlane isn't the only one guilty of this either, because South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker tried to pull the same thing with their movie Team America: World Police that featured a number of jokes regurgitated from their TV show, and it was stupid there too."
Ted 2,"That's not to say there aren't some jokes that work as some of the cameos are occasionally funny and MacFarlane and Wahlberg still have good chemistry, but for every moment that works there's others that just don't. The movie brings back Giovani Ribisi's Donny again and like the last movie he's not funny and is just odd and off-putting but some of the scenes he shared with John Carroll Lynch were mildly amusing, Amanda Seyfried's Sam Jackson (guess which joke they make) is just kind of there, and a lengthy sequence in Comic-Con only served to remind me how much better this was done when Nick Frost, Simon Pegg, and Seth Rogen did it in Paul."
Ted 2,"Ted 2 feels like an obligation sequel. It's cobbled together from leftover parts of both the first movie and MacFarlane's TV shows while still having the same problems with dated reference humor that has made the film age poorly. I say this as someone who likes MacFarlane's work, he can do better than this."
Ted 2,I really can't understand why many critics went harsh on this one.
Ted 2,"The film is jutted with quality humour - social, political and personal. It lives up to the expectations and doesn't slack anywhere at all. It makes us laugh but also makes us uneasy at times not because of crassness but because it reveals the underbelly of our social setup."
Ted 2,I am waiting for Ted 3 - I sincerely hope McFarlene considers it. Ted should run up for Governor or President. It will fit in nicely with the US presidentials in 2016 and should reveal the shallowness of modern political campaigning.
Ted 2,Go Seth go...
Ted 2,"If you're a fan of the first Ted movie you'll probably enjoy the second as well but I think everybody can pretty much agree the first one was a lot funnier. The performances are still decent with some laughs, the biggest problem is is the ho-hum story that isn't engaging. The freshness from the first movie is gone as well. All in all Ted 2 is a slightly fun little comedy if you enjoyed the first one just don't expect it to be as good."
Ted 2,"In 2012 when Seth Macfarlane's directorial debut was released, I, like many other people enjoyed it a lot. It was a basic film about a man and his senile teddy bear who would just smoke weed, swear a lot and hang out. That premise was enough to get us on board and it worked for a one off feature film. After the box office success it received a sequel was inevitable.. but how could a film with such a premise possibly do anything more to become a franchise? Well not only does Ted 2 ramp up the laughs, it also gives us a surprisingly strong plot and pulls it off well."
Ted 2,"The basic premise is that Ted has married Tammi-Lynn from the first film, whereas John has divorced Lori. Following some marital problems, Ted decides to save his marriage with a baby, but in order to do this he has to prove that he is a person and not just property in the eyes of the law. Enter Sam L. Jackson (Amanda Seyfried) and yes as you would expect there are many references to the Hollywood star. I knew Mila Kunis was not coming back for this film and after her performance in the lacklustre 'A million ways to die in the West' i was not expecting Seyfried to be a good replacement, but she fits in with the cast very well. Just like the first film the chemistry between John (Mark Wahlberg) and Ted (Seth Macfarlane) is what makes the comedy work so well, you really believe you are watching two real life friends hang out, rather than Mark Wahlberg and a CGI teddy bear. The plot wasn't what made the first so enjoyable, it was their bond. Amanda Seyfried fits in with these two so well and as a trio they really mesh well together. She brings a lot of laughs to the table and I actually liked her character more than Mila Kunis'."
Ted 2,"Whilst the plot is very good and holds up, the third act takes a bit of a plunge and almost copies the last act of the first film completely. Giovanni Risbi reprises his role as Donny and does exactly what he did originally, just for a slightly different reason. The film could have done without this to focus more on the human elements, even though it was hilarious to see Ninja turtle Raphael dance to 'I think we're alone now'. It almost felt like filler to make a longer movie. The small road trip segment to me was great, we got spoofs of both Planes, Trains and Automobiles and a great Jurassic Park spoof in the space of a couple of minutes. In fact the pop culture references from Rocky to Flash Gordon (Sam J Jones returns) were pretty great. I also loved the courtroom scenes, and even Morgan Freeman in an extended cameo provided us with a very good look at what human rights are all about."
Ted 2,"What i wanted from this film was to laugh, which i did, a lot more than i expected to as well which is a bonus. Look out for a hysterical cameo from Liam Neeson. The 'is Ted a human' storyline felt like a bold and wonderful step forward and brings up way more questions about human rights than any Seth Macfarlane production should.. but not in a bad way at all. It focuses a lot less on the drugs and crude jokes, even though they are very much still there! But the way it was executed was just great. I wish the third act had stuck with it, but by the end if you are a fan of Seth Macfarlane's work such as Family Guy you will come out satisfied after plenty of laughs and a surprising amount of heart. Will we get a Ted 3? Most likely, but if it keeps up what Ted 2 did right then i just might be okay with that."
Ted 2,"This film tells the story of a talking teddy bear who sues the government, so that he gets recognised as a human being and get human rights such as marriage and drivers license."
Ted 2,"""Ted 2"" is a hugely politically incorrect film, with a lot of swearing, sexual and crude humour. It is not usually a type of film I like, but ""Ted 2"" does have a way to get to my heart. It is sweet and emphasises a lot of love and friendship. Towards the end, the film gets very touching, and it made my eyes well up."
Ted 2,"Having a touching plot, together with a funny script makes ""Ted 2"" very entertaining, way more entertaining than I expected."
Ted 2,"The last thing Hollywood wants to do is either insult or offend individuals, groups, races, religions, causes, genders, and ideologies with their films. The refreshing thing about the hilarious teddy bear satire ""Ted"" and its unapologetic sequel ""Ted 2"" is that neither have any such compunctions. Seth MacFarlane, who co-scripted, directed, and provided the titular teddy bear's voice, spends most of ""Ted 2"" saying and showing subject matter most respectable people would think twice about before either saying or showing. Like its iconoclastic predecessor, ""Ted 2"" bears an R-rating for what the Motion Picture Association of America considers ""crude and sexual content, pervasive language, and some drug use."" The subversive humor either will make you cringe in horrific revulsion or howl in gleeful elation. If you enjoyed ""Ted"" with its cretinous heroes, beyond borderline gross out humor, wanton drug abuse, and impertinent profanity, you'll love this high-brow sequel. The worst thing you can say about ""Ted 2"" is it is pretentious from start to finish. Clearly, MacFarlane and ""Family Guy"" co-scribes Alec Sulken and Wellesley Wild sought to overshadow the lowbrow original, and they have triumphed in this respect. If you haven't seen ""Ted,"" you probably won't understand half of the hilarity. During a thunderstorm, young John Bennett clutched his Hasbro teddy and made a wish it would come to life, and it did! Subsequently, they became ""thunder buddies for life."" Virtually everybody from ""Ted"" reprises their roles in ""Ted 2,"" except Mila Kunis. According to the Internet Movie Database, Kunis didn't return as Lori because she was pregnant during the production with Ashton Kutcher's baby. Meantime, MacFarlane and his co-scribes explain that John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg of ""Contraband"") and she divorced for six months before the outset of the action. A dejected John is petrified of getting himself involved in another relationship and his life has spiraled out of control. Meantime, Ted and Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth of ""Next"") marry, but their marriage has degenerated into a disaster. They argue about finances, throw things, and Ted cusses out their neighbors. At the supermarket where Ted works as a cashier, an obese African-American cashier advises him that the best way to restore a marriage is to have a baby. Tami-Lynn breaks her angry vow of silence with Ted after he tells her they must have a baby, and they celebrate their momentous decision."
Ted 2,"Sadly, neither are prepared for the trials and tribulations that ensue. Since the toy company Hasbro didn't endow Ted with sex organs, our hero must search for the ideal sperm donor. They approach Flash (Sam J. Jones), but he complains about his low sperm count. John suggests Patriots' quarterback Tom Brady. Now, things get really bizarre. John and Ted sabotage Brady's air conditioner so he has to sleep with his bedroom balcony windows open. These two nitwits set out to obtain a sperm sample from Brady while he is asleep! Ted decks himself out like a seafaring fisherman for the occasion, and John is appalled to learn that he must masturbate Brady. Fortunately, for everybody involved, Brady awakens in time and throws them out. Johnny offers to help Ted, and they enter a fertility clinic. A comedy of errors occurs when John tips over a storage bin of sperm samples accidentally and gets covered with sperm. Nevertheless, everything goes awry when Tammy-Lynn's physician (Dennis Haysbert) informs her that she devastated her reproductive system abusing narcotics. Ultimately, Ted learns the State of Massachusetts no longer recognizes his status as a person so they cannot adopt a child. Furthermore, the court has invalidated their marriage. Ted and John seek legal representation. The best they can afford is 26-year old Samantha Leslie Jackson (Amanda Seyfried of ""Les Misérables""), a freshman attorney who smokes a bong to counteract the ill effects of migraines. Predictably, since Ted and John are still getting wasted, several scenes of euphoric pot-smoking ensue, with our heroes and heroine smoking in public places, too."
Ted 2,"Just when everything appears to be working out favorably for our heroes, the villainous Donnie from ""Ted"" surfaces. Donnie (Giovanni Ribisi of ""Public Enemies"") has gotten a job as a janitor now at Hasbro. He interrupts Hasbro executive Tom Jessup (John Carroll Lynch of ""Zodiac"") during a hallway conference and tells him that he doesn't flip the cakes in his urinal. Instead, he replaces them. Naturally, Jessup doesn't know what to make of this sinister cretin. Later, Donnie has a moment with Jessup in Jessup's office because Hasbro has an open-door policy with its employees. The news is out that Ted is going to court to determine what his status in society is. Donnie tells Jessup if the prosecution can prove that Ted is actually property rather than a person, they can abduct him with minor legal consequences, slice him open, and fathom what makes Ted so singular. Jessup's eyes gleam at the prospect of eviscerating Ted so Hasbro can manufacture a new teddy that will sell millions."
Ted 2,"Mind you, Ted the talking teddy still looks as adorable as he did in first film. You never get the impression the cast was interacting with nothing when the CGI Ted was on-screen with them. While Ted dominates the action with his woes, Mark Wahlberg's John stands out as his best friend. Until ""Ted"" and now again with ""Ted 2,"" Wahlberg has deviated rarely from playing a straight-up, conventional, role model, W.A.S.P. protagonist. As he did initially with ""Ted,"" Wahlberg appears to be poaching on Adam Sandler territory with some of his absurd antics. The splashy scene in the sperm facility and the loony episode in Tom Brady's mansion make John the butt of the jokes, and Wahlberg displays no inhibitions to playing second banana to Ted while ridiculing himself in the process. The dialogue again qualifies as quotable material with politically incorrect meanings. Although the sight gags are amusing, this above-average gross-out comedy serves up some pretty impudent shenanigans. Indeed, if vulgar humor poses no problems, ""Ted 2"" is right for you."
Ted 2,"Ted 2 does exactly what it set out to do. It delivers a bunch of laughs built primarily on crude, in-your-face humor and it doesn't take itself too seriously. Seth MacFarlane proves once again that he has his finger firmly on the pulse of his target demographic because the theater was in stitches throughout most of the film. That being said, a comedy doesn't have to sacrifice cinema in order to deliver laughs. I think the first movie was a prime example of that, as it was a genuinely good movie in addition to being hilarious. Instead, MacFarlane turns this movie into a live-action version of Family Guy. The plot is choppy and it essentially feels like a series of random skits, pieced together to form the semblance of some over-arcing plot. It was easily worth watching because it was hilarious but I expected a quality film closer to that of the first one."
Ted 2,"Oh my god, my jaws are literally sore after watching this film, it was extremely uplifting!"
Ted 2,I think Seth MacFarlane always has these rough and bright ideas to make brilliant films like this. I really liked the first movie of Ted and I really liked the sequel too!
Ted 2,"At the beginning of the film, when we hear old beat music and Ted dancing with the ladies & gents, it really reminded me of Family guy plus MacFarlane's love of Frank Sinatra-like music. I felt like joining the crowd like seriously!"
Ted 2,"I was so so relieved that Mark Walberg's character didn't die, otherwise the film would be screwed on having him just be killed off. However, thank god it didn't happen the way I thought!"
Ted 2,I would really hope they make a third film because Ted is awesome!
Ted 2,"I remember the first Ted movie being more jammed packed with jokes and gags. Not that Ted 2 does not make me roll on the floor with laughter,"
Ted 2,"But in this movie, Ted attempts to adopt a baby after marring Tami- Lynn only to have the system catch up with him and realize that he's not a real person, but someone's property, so Ted goes to court for his Civil Rights, a beautifully message especially at this time, with the movie suggesting the plot was inspired by the fight for same sex marriage (or considering what a pop culture junkie Seth Macfarlane is, he probably was mostly inspired by the 80s movie Short Circuit 2 which has a similar concept)"
Ted 2,"It's a good plot line that makes you think about what it means to be a real person. The whole layout reminds me more of Seth's other animated series, American Dad, which had a lot of episodes that had a strong message, layered under fart jokes."
Ted 2,"It's a no brainier for those of us who love Family Guy(I recognized one of the sight gags from the animated series coming to live-action in the movie), and for those of us who are pop culture junkies (My biggest laughs are when they go to comic con), and then there is a huge chunk of the sequel (a really big one) with the concept of equality,to grasp a new demographic and prove to the world that Macfarlene is not a complete jerk."
Ted 2,"It's a good message about humanity but it does make Ted 2 less funny than Ted, but it's still worth seeing."
Ted 2,"I saw ""Ted 2"", starring Mark Wahlberg-Lone Survivor, The Perfect Storm; the voice of Seth MacFarlane-A Million Ways to Die in the West, Tooth Fairy; Amanda Seyfried-A Million Ways to Die in the West, Jennifer's Body; Jessica Barth-Get Smart_2008, Next and Giovanni Ribisi-A Million Ways to Die in the West, Avatar."
Ted 2,"This is the sequel to the 2012 Ted, in case you could not tell by the number 2 in the title. Most of the original actors return, except Mila Kunis, and it is explained why she is not in the picture. The movie opens with Seth/Ted and Jessica getting married. It's not long before they start having marital problems-just like everybody else in the whole wide world does-and they decide to have a baby because, as everyone knows, that always solves the problem. But Seth, being a teddy bear, well he has no ......genitalia. Their only options are to adopt or use a sperm donor and that's when things get complicated. Seth has to go to court to prove he is a person or his status would be that he is considered just ordinary property. His old thunder buddy for life, Mark, helps by getting Amanda, an inexperienced lawyer, to fight for Seth and Jessica. Giovanni shows up hoping that Seth loses in court so that he can use Seth in his own personal schemes. There is a scene involving the NY Comic Con that should bring a tingle to any nerds out there-me included. There are several good cameos; I remember seeing Liam Neesom, Jay Leno and Tom Brady, just to mention a few. FYI: there is a scene after the end credits that includes one of the three cameos that I just mentioned. It's rated ""R"" for language, drug use and sexual content-including nudity- and has a running time of 1 hour & 55 minutes. If you liked the first one, then you should enjoy this one. In fact, I laughed a lot and I think this one is better. I would buy it on Blu-Ray."
Ted 2,"The first one was funny, but the sequel is a little better cause it has adventure and misadventure to put the Ted character and his friends into. Why I liked Ted 2 better than Hot Tub Time Machine 2, well the Hot Tub sequel could not make any of the gags work, they threw anything out there and it really shows, and nobody was interesting and likable. But in Ted 2 was the total opposite, you really like the characters despite the stupid things they do, leave it to Seth Macfarlane, who can make you be charmed by foul humor and gross out gags."
Ted 2,"Ted(voiced by Seth Macfarlane) wants to have a baby with his wife, but then he is questioned by the law, he is human or property?"
Ted 2,"Mark Wahlberg and Seth Macfarlane where funny, and have a great comic chemistry. So does Amanda Seyfried has there lawyer, I mean you see that they where having the best time making this. At times it feels like you are watching a Family Guy episode at times cause of all the homages to other classics. All the other supporting cast do well also. This film is like Dumb and Dumber To, not great films, but funny and entertaining films. If you are not into to this, then you avoid this then."
Ted 2,"Seth MacFarlene, along with Mark Wahlberg returns as the trash-talking teddy bear who brought the laughs and fun in this sequel to 2012's hit comedy Ted. Mila Kunis, however, was unable to return as Mark Wahlberg's girlfriend from the first film. This time around, Ted has married Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth), his feisty girlfriend from the first film. One year's passes by, they begin dealing with marital problems until Ted hatches an idea for them to have a baby, hoping it would solve marriage problems. His plans only ends harder than he expected. To make matter worse, the government rules that Ted is not a human citizen, which results in him losing his jobs, losing his bank account, and having his marriage with Tami-Lynn annulled. In attempt to get his life back together, Ted and his buddy John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) get help from a lawyer named Sam (Amanda Seyfried) for a court case to prove he should be considered human."
Ted 2,"After seeing the first film, I was more than excited for a sequel. As most sequels to comedies go, I didn't expect this to be as good as the first one. However, it ended being almost as good as the first film. It contained plenty of hilarious dialogue that had me laughing almost constantly. Yes, the dialogue is pretty raunchy and vulgar like it was in the first film, or perhaps even more so. Nonetheless, I was satisfied with it. The gags were pretty funny, especially during the scene when Ted and John were visiting the hospital to get sperm for Ted's baby. There are a few gross-out scenes that may not be funny to everyone, the hospital scene being a perfect example. Ted was funny as ever and often stole the show with his off-the-wall humor. Mark Wahlberg was also quite funny as well, perhaps even more so than in the first movie. In this one, his character is even more dumb and often lead Ted and himself into the most hysterical and unpleasant shenanigans. I also pleased by the casting of Amanda Seyfried as the lawyer who helps John and Ted during their mission. I think her character was very clever and well written, even if she wasn't as funny as Ted and John. The storyline was okay, even though I felt that the film could had a better plot."
Ted 2,"This film may have gotten mixed reviews, but I think it deserves higher. If you loved the first film, there is a very good chance you will enjoy this one. Even if it may not level with the first one, it is still worth seeing."
Ted 2,"If there was a 6.5, I would give it. Because there was a lot to like in this movie. I like Mark Wahlberg. I like the bear. I like Amanda Seyfried. And there were a lot of good laughs in this movie. Good one-liners, and good recurring gags."
Ted 2,"However, it just wasn't enough to make up for a horrible plot. The plot is lifted from ""Miracle on 43rd Street."" But it is not Christmas, Ted is not Santa. Somehow Ted does not rise to the mythical level of Santa, this is not a movie for kids. and the movie falls flat. Markie Mark is same as ever, and I do enjoy him. Kudos to Amanda Seyfried, who tries so hard to make the romance story line work. But I could never get past the fact that I was watching MW and AS and a wise-cracking stuffed bear. Some good laughs? Yes. A good story? Not even close."
Ted 2,"The thing about Ted is that as soon as that teddy bear opens his mouth the first thought that comes into my mind is Peter Griffin, which is not surprising considering MacFarlane does the voices for both characters. Anyway, since I quite enjoyed the first movie when I discovered that he had made a sequel I knew that it was one of those films that was going to give me some good laughs, and I must say that it certainly didn't disappoint. Okay, it is basically more of the same, but then sometimes doing what one does best is the only way to go, and having been a fan of Family Guy, I pretty much knew what I was going to expect."
Ted 2,"Once again we have a flow of big name stars making appearances, including Liam Neeson in his Taken role coming into the grocery store to buy a packet of children's cereal, but making sure nobody actually knows that he is buying it. While I thought that was quite amusing the one scene that simply sticks in my mind was when they went into the lawyer's office and the lawyer pulls out a bong and starts smoking it, puts it down and says 'I hope you don't mind'. That was so absurd that I simply cannot believe it ever happening, but the fact that it did makes me give this movie the stars that it deserves. Anyway, I feel that I might end up giving away too many of the jokes, so I will simply say 'help me home', and if you are wondering what I mean by that, then go an see the movie and you will understand."
Ted 2,"Anyway, Ted gets married, but it turns out that after about six months (I believe) they are starting to have problems, so it is suggested that they have a child. Unfortunately Ted just doesn't have the equipment, and his wife, having been a coke fiend, can't have children, so they decide to adopt. Unfortunately the state decides that Ted isn't actually a human, he is property, so he can't adopt, which results in him being stripped of all of his rights, which is why he lands up in a lawyers office – he wants his rights back and wants to be considered a sentient human like everybody else."
Ted 2,"Anyway, I don't really want to go much deeper than that because while there is the idea about being considered a human, and the still simmering issue of race in America, this film is basically all about having a laugh at a couple of really obnoxious and dope smoking losers (though I must admit that Whalberg does a brilliant job in this film – as he did in the last; I still can't believe that this was the guy who was the lead singer of Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch). Along with the laughs the film does force you to think about the issue of race and the fact that not too long ago the same argument was being made about the status of the African American."
Ted 2,"After the good box-office performance of ""Ted"", this sequel was already predictable. It is especially recommended to those who liked the first film and especially advised against all people whose good sense and good taste prevented them from properly enjoying it. The film brings nothing new, just continuing the story of the obscene and rude teddy bear that shone in the initial film. Unfortunately, the manners and behavior of the creature have in no way improved, continuing to be the perfect mirror of a generation of teenagers with no prospects of life, no education, no manners and obsessed with everything that has to do with sex, alcohol or induce hallucinogenic states. The film is supposed to be a comedy but, viewed from this perspective, it takes on tragic and deeply unhappy contours. But I'm not surprised. I was not expecting Seth MacFarlane, a man who likes to make movies and serials with offensive and provocative humor, had suddenly turned into an Amish or something like that. But I remain in doubt whether the art of cinema needed another junk-film for its vast collection. In any case, the film has an advantage (the only one): as a social critic, it allows us all to think whether we want to be equal or better than that bear, and allows me (and others like me) to write texts like this."
Ted 2,"I'm not the biggest fan of Mila Kunis, nor am I a huge fan of Seth MacFarlane. But despite my hesitations, I liked the original Ted quite a bit, for a variety of reasons; despite its obvious crudeness, it had some character development and poignancy that the film medium was able to afford MacFarlane that a TV cartoon wasn't able to. As much of an ostensibly ""bro"" movie as it was, it had some subversive commentary on the male id, and Mila Kunis' character was written quite well; she didn't come across as the harping, shrill female stereotype so often seen in movies about male arrested development (see: ""Saving Silverman""). For every time Wahlberg and his teddy bear seemed to have a valid reason to continue their destructive friendship, she had an equally valid reason that they shouldn't."
Ted 2,"How disappointing, then, that Ted 2 opens with Kunis' character lazily written off, discarded by Wahlberg's character as ""the wrong woman"" (or something to such an effect) so that MacFarlane can introduce a new love interest in the form of Amanda Seyfried, who is a fine actress in better written roles but simply isn't given the same level of material to work with here."
Ted 2,"The other memorable aspect of Ted was simply the novelty factor: ""potty-mouthed teddy bear."" This was a simple premise that appealed to everyone everywhere, which is why it was one of the rare blockbuster comedies to make a lot of money overseas."
Ted 2,"But now we have Ted 2, and the novelty is worn off. The balance of the first film is gone, too; the crudeness there was offset with surprisingly sweet, character-driven moments; here, because we don't really believe the characters from the onset (see: Kunis' character being shrugged off), there really aren't as many tender moments. None of it really rings true, it just seems like a typical sequel going through the motions trying to replicate the original but inevitably failing to do so simply because the appeal is a one-off (it kind of reminds me of the Hangover sequels)."
Ted 2,"Like the Hangover sequels, this isn't as bad as the critics might lead you to believe. It's not a terrible film. It's safe to say that, if you liked the original Ted, you'll at least find this an entertaining enough diversion for a one-time viewing. I also dug that they brought back Giovanni Ribisi, the best part of the first film, despite the fact that his inclusion made no sense whatsoever."
Ted 2,"But this simply isn't as clever, funny, well-written or - frankly - surprisingly tender and sweet as the first movie. It's a decent rental but I hope there's no Ted 3."
Ted 2,"Seriously. When are comedy sequels EVER better than the original? If you'd count Lethal Weapon 2 as a comedy, then that might be the exception. But, since it's not, the streak remains. That said, this film cracked me up from beginning to end. Though, some jokes didn't work, and some were only funny the first 2 of 10 times – seen a black cock lately? – and the movie was far too long, for the majority, it worked as an excellent supplement to the original, which I'll always laugh out loud with. And the human rights plot – how perfectly it fit with the release date, June 26, 2015the same day the Supreme Court ruled in favor of human rights to gays and lesbians and marriage. Well played, Ted. Well played."
Ted 2,* * *
Ted 2,"Final thoughts: Of course, two different couples brought their 4-8 year olds into see this movie. Egad. Liam Neeson said it best, well, summed up: Trix are for kids, Ted is for adults, you idiots."
Ted 2,"Movie was hilarious, besides certain awkward scenes, especially the introduction they could of done without, mark Walberg: never considered him a funny actor. But he has done very well in this movie franchise, Seth Macfarlane is a talented comedian director and creator The girl from dear john did very well filling Mila Kunis shoes, usually sequels bomb!!! But not this film very impressed how funny it came out, story line was mediocre but funny scenes made up for it. Usually sequels are over budget big propaganda and it started at first but the funny dialogue and thr hilarious scenes made not only myself but the people at the movie theater, rotten tomatoes rated this a 4.0 what the hell do.they know they always give crappy rating for funny movies, and as soon as they get a check from a crappy movie they rate those high, they are a insult not only to me but to all the real movie buffs so sit back and Enjoy it people Mike Sanchez (popcorn n movie)"
Ted 2,"This movie is terrifically funny. It provokes laughter from start to finish. It is virtually impossible not to like the character Ted - A teddy bear that wants to be treated like a human. Simple ideas make for great stories as this movie proves. Mark Wahlberg is the straight man and shows that he is one of the great comic actors. What is more remarkable is that the story is actually a court room drama, but involving characters that are so ridiculously lovable as to transform the story into a spoof, which works as comedy. Everything Ted says is funny and on point. There is an edge to the humor, which makes it even funnier. Just because Ted is a toy doesn't mean he lacks feelings. Ted is whatever we want him to be."
Ted 2,"Ted 2 lets talk about it! OK i saw this film 2 months ago at an early screening and unlike a few idiots on here i actually kept my mouth shut due to the embargo and quiet possibly getting sued if i let any info slip lol. Anyways i ENJOYED this movie a ton!!! Let's get one thing straight here, if you didn't like the 1st TED or you don't like anything Seth Mcfarlane related then STAY AWAY! This movie isn't for you and it won't change your mind about anything. I LOVED the first ted and i knew that this movie might be a weak sequel like most sequels are now in days...... and surprise, surprise it actually exceeded my expectations. Ted 2 is almost as good as the first! ALMOST! One of my concerns was the cast change, i hate when movies replace or change characters in sequels. SO i felt that Mila Kunis's absence was going to be very obvious and there would be a hole in this movie that the new lead Amanda Seyfried just could not fill. AND another surprise! Her character worked to PERFECTION!!! The chemistry that she had with Mark Wahlberg and Seth Mcfarlane was just amazing. I was like ""there's no way she could be better than Mila"" and BOOM she nailed it."
Ted 2,"The story most of you may already know from the trailers, Ted gets married and then the State says Ted is property and not a person so the marriage is annulled and he basically loses everything. So the story worked, the first movie focused more on John and this one is more about ted. I had no real complaints with this film, there is a cameo with Liam Neeson which IMO was just pointless and not that funny.... There are some moments where they try too hard with the jokes or to be shocking but Besides a few nitpicks i had no complaints with this movie! It is laugh out loud funny, it has serious moments similar to the first and it's just a fun film! There are some returning characters and i won't spoil that. And ohh yeah the Comic Con scene in this film with Patrick Warburton and the running gag they have going on is SUPER HILARIOUS!!! I'm giving TED 2 an 8.5/10."
Ted 2,"Seth Macfarlane yet again proves that his brand of humour isn't everyone's cup of tea. In fact it's not for many with his latest feature length film. Ted was all about the thunder buddies and the ups and downs of their relationship. The second takes a completely different approach. Instead of mocking political subjects, which Ted 2 focuses on, Macfarlane fills up it's long running-time by abusing celebrities, with distasteful dick jokes and awkward racism. This time round the puns invoke little or no reaction. Mila Kunis is sorely missed, replaced by a reputable but unconvincing Amanda Seyfried as a lawyer. John Bennett (Walhberg) and Ted's (Macfarlane) relationship never flourishes past the first film. Big shock, when it's their banter and wild antics that made the Ted so outrageously entertaining."
Ted 2,"I came to laugh, and laugh I did. ""Ted 2"" is a ridiculously stupid movie, the thing is, when Seth MacFarlane directs it, I like it more than the average dumb guy movie. I was gut-busting more times than I expected to. Was it as inspired and heartfelt as the first? Of course not. It would've benefited if it was, but there is only so much you could squeeze out of a pot-smoking bear, without getting more of the same.. lots of fuzz. The story is predictable, yes. Yet it stays away from being too serious, which I applaud MacFarlane for doing this time around. He divulged in some really hacky melodrama in ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"", and I prayed that it didn't happen here. Luckily, he doubles down on the laughs. However, he also doubles down on the offensiveness. This is a mean movie, folks. Prepare to scoff and scowl at how low it goes. Some of it does work, partially due to how Ted's racism and homophobia is humorously typical of a loud Bostonian. I'm not sure how anyone will feel about Ferguson and Charlie Hebdo, and Robin Williams death jokes. The 22.3 year rule has never applied to Seth MacFarlane. For him, it's about a 4 month rule. Putting aside all of the flaws, I can happily say that ""Ted 2"" delivers as a comedy. It's a vast improvement over Seth's last film, and it's making me crave third film. But if they have to put the bear to bed, so be it."
Ted 2,"""Newlywed couple Ted and Tami-Lynn want to have a baby, but in order to qualify to be a parent, Ted will have to prove he's a person in a court of law."" The subtext for this film is rich and one could easily equate Ted's dilemma with most minorities. And the heavy subject matter is handled with crass humor and over the top stoner gems. Did I mention the bear likes to get high?"
Ted 2,"Seth Mac Farlane is known for wit from the TV shows ""Family Guy"" and ""American Dad"" and his step into feature films have, at least from my behalf, always been interesting to watch. He tackled his first feature film, sans the Family Guy characters, ""Ted"" then moved onto, ""A Million Ways to die in the West"" and now ""Ted 2"". His style of humour includes jokes without the drum roll to let the audience know that was a punchline. It's the sitcom without the laughing. Most audiences need to know when the end of the joke has arrived and the lack thereof is a MacFarlane trade that works so well, at least for the fans. And if you're a fan then this second run at the inappropriate little teddy is well worth it."
Ted 2,"The reference to Amanda Seyfried's eyes (again) is golden. In the western film, ""A Million Ways to die in the West"", is this hilarious scene where Charlize Theron can't believe Amanda is so blind with eyes that big. It makes me laugh just thinking about it. Now in ""Ted 2"" they dig even deeper with a visual comparison that leaves me laughing as I write. Keep your eyes out for it."
Ted 2,"The film did have one too many unnecessary establishing shots, which merely drags a film. Trimming the fat would have made the films pace so much more enjoyable. Here's an example: they're in the hospital room, something goes wrong and they need to move to the waiting room, then there's the establishing shot of the hospital and to the waiting room. The establishing shot was unnecessary because we already know we're in a hospital. Just trim the fat."
Ted 2,Other than that Ted 2 is very enjoyable. A great crude comedy that is relentless with the jokes finding ways to pull a giggle from the audience at every given chance.
The Riot Club,"This film tells the story of two freshmen at Oxford University, who are invited to join the exclusive club called The Riot Club."
The Riot Club,"I have to say this film surpasses every bit of my expectations. From the story, acting, sets and the messages behind the film, everything absorbs me and engrossed me. It shocks me deeply, and provokes much thought about the discrepancy between the world of the young elites and the general public's perception of them."
The Riot Club,"The story quickly builds towards trouble, and I already had a feeling that the dinner will end badly towards the middle of the film. Even though what the club members did was not socially acceptable, even after taking into account their state of intoxication. However, what shocks me isn't their mere irresponsible, disrespectful and even lawless behaviour. It doesn't shock me that they could get away with it because they have power and money. What shocked me is that they can have no remorse, and are still expected to have a superbly bright future. As they say, they aren't the sort of people who make mistakes. It's such a along chilling statement."
The Riot Club,"It pains me to see the bar owner having to take such a misfortune. He is shown to be honest, hardworking, and treats his guests with much respect. He can be likened to the commoners, having to take whatever misfortune the rich descends upon them."
The Riot Club,"""The Riot Club"" is not just a film about drunken young adults. It is really about class struggle and societal oppression. It is a must watch. I'm still in a daze an hour after watching it, shocked by the events portrayed in it."
The Riot Club,"After an amusing introductory scene that informs you of the club's centuries' old origin, the film turns to contemporary Oxford and presents us with the latest generation of students and Riot Club members. It follows first-year students Miles Richards (Max Irons) and Alistair Ryle (Sam Claflin), both are of 'good stock' but the former is normal and down-to-earth and the latter is a malicious, fascistic sociopath."
The Riot Club,"During the fresher's activities, Miles quickly befriends the middle- class Lauren (Holliday Grainger), a friendly girl from Northern England; the romantic pair have a sweet naturalism as they playfully talk about and erode their differing heritages. The scowling, aloof Alistair however proves to be not much of a conversationalist."
The Riot Club,"Both are soon inaugurated into the Riot Club, whose other members include Harry Villiers (Douglas Booth), the pretty boy who struck me as the de-facto leader of the club; Hugo Fraser-Tyrwhitt (Sam Reid), a closet homosexual with an attraction to Miles; Dimitri Mitropolous (Ben Schnetzer), a horribly rich Greek student, and James Leighton- Masters (Freddie Fox), the smug little squirt who's somehow the president of the club. Some have said that it is littered with caricatures, however the film isn't about ordinary Oxford students or ordinary privilege, it is about an elite circle of extreme wealth and aristocracy."
The Riot Club,"After Miles and Alistair make up the Riot Club's ten members, the group soon have their risibly pompous suits tailored and set off for a night's debauchery to The Old Bull, one of the few establishments they haven't been banned from. By the time this happens, I thought I had the measure of the pretentious characters and the film's narrative and tone, however as the 'dinner' progresses, both the characters and the course of events become veritably loathsome."
The Riot Club,"As most will know, The Riot Club is inspired by the Bullingdon Club, an Oxford University dining society infamous for its destructive hedonism that boasts alumni such as David Cameron, Boris Johnson and George Osborne. The film's main target of attack isn't the purported anti-social behaviour of such people, the obnoxious decadence we witness is not endemic to the highly disagreeable 'Riot Club', what it attacks is rather the characters' raging, blue-blooded superiority complexes that causes it. Some may disagree with its politics, they may consider it a gross exaggeration; it is indeed vehement in its depiction of class wars, however I think it is undeniably a very well executed piece of filmmaking."
The Riot Club,"The film is adapted from the stage play Posh by Laura Wade, and the middle section of the narrative, which is one long scene, certainly feels like the work of a playwright. Like Tracy Letts' Killer Joe (2011) and Bug (2006), it is another example of how punchy stage material often makes an excellent transfer to the cinema."
The Riot Club,"Much like Letts' work, The Riot Club contains a maelstrom within a cramped four walls; the scene goes from embarrassing to plain excruciating as the decuplet, fuelled by alcohol, drugs and each other's presence, become increasingly hateful and immoral, the vile crescendo eventually reaching a climax that's genuinely shocking. It is all witnessed by the unassuming pub landlord. He is initially honoured to host the boys, the sight of him sycophantically at the beck and call of people half his age who look at him the way they would dog mess on their shoe is pathetic in the true meaning of the word."
The Riot Club,"The worst offender is Alistair, Sam Claflin is excellent when delivering his well-written diatribes with drunken, acerbic hatred. Alistair's genocidal contempt for the working classes and those bereft of prestige bore similarities to Adolf Hitler's loathing of Jews; he gets so angry that he's reduced to saying 'I'm sick to f*cking death of poor people!' Alistair is the most odious example of unearned privilege and arrogant sense of entitlement, he rants about the successes and innovations of the ruling classes and the proletariat's supposed jealousy as if he's had a part in it, after all, what exactly has he achieved apart from winning the genetic lottery? Claflin proves himself as an accomplished villain actor, he gives his character a sociopathic quality; when there aren't flashes of his vulgar jealousy, resentment and massive hubris, Alistair has an unnerving emotional vacuity."
The Riot Club,"The Riot Club is not simply 107 minutes of pretty boys holding champagne flutes, it is a sharply made thriller that is perhaps politically divisive but rivetingly executed."
The Riot Club,"For the vast majority of us, The Riot Club is so far removed from our own experience as to be virtually irrelevant. The same is probably true with Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street, but while I spent the first half of that triumph wishing I could have Jordan Belfort's experiences and the second half thanking some unknown deity I haven't, there was something about him I couldn't help liking. In The Riot Cub, however, we are presented with an odious bunch of toffs with few, if any, redeeming features."
The Riot Club,"Alistair (Sam Claflin) and Miles (Max Irons), both aristocratic and with either latent or pronounced class prejudices, begin their first term at Oxford University. Their social standing makes them attractive prospects for the infamous Riot Club. With a maximum membership of ten at any time, mystery surrounds the exclusive, secret society that has a closer bond than the Masons and a legendary penchant for excess, debauchery and a privileged standing that means the members never suffer the consequences of their hedonism. Banned from Oxford's finer establishments, the Club prepares for their annual dinner and the investiture of their news members."
The Riot Club,"I'm not sure The Riot Club has anything much to say. Is it a piece of social commentary? If so, we already know there are those who are moneyed, privileged and get away with murder, sometimes literally. If it is to excite us and make us hanker for the greener grass on the other side of the fence, it fails; why would we want that? If director Lone Scherfig (One Day, An Education) is aiming to show us how fortunate we are not to be part of that world, then surely there are subtler ways of doing so."
The Riot Club,"The Riot Club isn't a bad film; it is just a largely unpleasant one. This is a voyeuristic look through a grimy window at a display of wanton abandon and viciousness at the expense of absolutely everyone who isn't, or wasn't, part of The Riot Club. While most naughty boys think they can get away with scrumping apples, bunking off school and firing catapults at innocent, harmless animals, these are loathsome, obnoxious boys who grew up on a campaign of hatred and swapped their misdemeanours for felonies like vandalism, violence, and rape."
The Riot Club,"Nice club! Perhaps for those who have been through that educational experience and are part of that tiny segment of society of privileged society it means something. Certainly the man behind me laughed periodically in apparent understanding. He was the only one in our small audience. Me? I felt uncomfortable through most of it, particularly with the pseudo morality of Miles when he apparently tries to do the right thing and rise above it, though his peers do not hold back in reminding him he, too, is there by choice."
The Riot Club,"The Riot Club is well performed by all, the attention to detail feels meticulous, from the perspective of one on the outside, and, yes, there is a part of me that enjoyed it. It was a fascinating experience that repulsed me frequently and left me feeling rather dirty; a little like the evening I had rotten.com inflicted on me by a long-eschewed former colleague."
The Riot Club,"I suspect The Riot Club will have a limited audience and most of those who venture out will find something within it to fascinate them. I can't imagine many in my circle of friends wanting a repeat viewing or wishing for a life in the inner circle of society afterwards, though."
The Riot Club,"Well constructed, fascinating and repulsive, The Riot Club is a classic example of a film that is good, despite the subject matter being thoroughly unpleasant."
The Riot Club,"For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."
The Riot Club,The Riot Club is an exclusive hedonistic drinking club in Oxford University with a long tradition. The group needs two new members to complete the ten minimum. Alistair Ryle and Miles Richards are new students with connections. Miles starts a relationship with Lauren from the working class. Right winger Alistair gets mugged and then recruited into the group. Harry Villiers is an older member whose ancestor was the original Lord Riot. James Leighton-Masters is the group's president. Hugo Fraser-Tyrwhitt is Miles' former classmate. They weren't close but Hugo remembers Miles. Their annual dinner at a country restaurant causes mounting rowdiness and chaos.
The Riot Club,"These are entitled rich brats. None of them are that compelling as individual characters. Most of them are too interchangeable. Their hi-jinx are annoying and not particularly imaginative. It's a lot of drinking and destruction. Throwing in Natalie Dormer as a hooker does help. There is boring boorish talk and a couple of interesting moments. The scene with Lauren in the restaurant is wrong. It's excusable that Miles is drunk but Lauren is too slow on the uptick. Even then, Miles can't be that weak-minded. It makes no sense that he doesn't leave to chase after Lauren other than for the sake of the story. There are a few clunky moments. It's unbelievable that the guys don't do more than a night in the drunk tank. They walk out with their clothes which should be taken as evidence. The only way to make it all work is if the cops are bought off right away. The possibility is there but it's not sharp enough."
The Riot Club,"It's hard to distinguish what's fact and what's fiction in The Riot Club. On one side secret societies will always have their debauchery and initiations, so a level of trouble-making's to be expected. On the other, TRC exaggerates the misbehavior of a notorious Oxford University group. It's a not so fine line between the two. One single dinner event escalates out of control, subjecting the divide between the rich and the working class. The Riot Club's an infuriating watch, with the majority of the club's members basking in their 'importance', looking down on those they believe to be beneath them. The performances are solid, especially from the club's newest members (Sam Claflin and Max Irons), but two thirds of this film is spent focusing on their petty squabbles than relatable facets."
The Riot Club,I found it a really profound storyline. Meaningful. Colourful. A peak into the modern (and ancient) class divides in the UK. And now horrible rich peopls are.
The Riot Club,"I was captivated as I sat in terror through this movie. Shocked, not by violence, but by the attitude of the memebers of the Riot Club. The lack of empathy, care, humanity."
The Riot Club,"I enjoyed how the plot shifted and got me constantly guessing who is the antagonist and who's the protagonist. It was also a really beautiful movie. The cinematography was great, but not overly original."
The Riot Club,Great acting from Sam Clafin.
The Riot Club,"But the greatness of this movie is the storyline. Its so good, striking and upsetting that I never want to watch it again."
The Riot Club,"The Riot Club is for posh boys, who all attend Oxford university. There are only ten of them at a time and they have a notorious reputation, and best of all? They are looking for new members. So I suppose the reel question is will this be Dirty Pretty Things or just Filth? The Riot Club is a film that has a feeling of disappointment, not from me, but from itself, it feels like a movie that had more to give us and wanted to but can never quite get into the right gear with it's own inner mechanics, it's a film that comes across as unhappy with it's own final piece."
The Riot Club,"The film has a lot of things going for it despite this, it has an INCREDIBLE cast of young men, the whole premise is pitched just right and when it needs to the tension is palpitatable, So why isn't it a better movie? I think we need to take a second look at this to get to the bottom of it properly."
The Riot Club,"The Riot Club begins as it means to go on, within the first 5 minuets we are shown hard drug use, strong sex scenes, violence and bad language, it never tries to hide or conceal what it is, but then I suppose this is where the problem starts because a movie like The Riot Club (much like A Clockwork Orange really), tries to live in two camps at once, those being the one of class commentary and the other of exploitation cinema. Nobody is going to defend The Riot Club for not being an exploitation film."
The Riot Club,"I think the thing that The Riot Club lacks most noticeably when compared to both the trailer and the general air of the film is ferocity. When I sat down to watch The Riot Club I expected darkness and debauchery, and what I ended up getting was something mildly unsettling, sure there are flurries of vindictiveness in the film, but they are in the trailer. I wanted to see a film that would justify the tenseness that I felt during some of the periods of the movie, but instead what I came out with was a feeling of confusion to what the hell happened to it all."
The Riot Club,"The Riot Club works perfectly to a pint, and then during the third act totally loses its way and decides it's run out of time anyway, so brings everything to a screeching halt almost mid flow. That is a crime I can't forgive, to deny me a justified ending to a film I was largely enjoying is wrong."
The Riot Club,"I feel it goes without saying that film has a superior showing of young up and comers, but what I feel should be said is that aside from the main male dominated teens, there is a surprising mix of other actors and actresses too, this is always a welcomed surprise."
The Riot Club,"At times The Riot Club is funny, at times it's uncomfortable but it never reaches the depths it desires or needed to for me. The talents on display are strong and that's what lifts it above the mundane."
The Riot Club,"The riot club is the first movie that I went to see this year and it  did not disappoint. The movie started off like a British comedy and I  immediately felt ripped off because it wasn't the movie I expected to  see. I don't know what exactly I was expecting but I can tell you that  I did not except to feel so strongly about it. It was a roller coaster  ride of emotions. As much as it is unsettling, I like when a movie  makes me uneasy, takes me out of my comfort zone. I might have felt  like this because I only expected excess and debauchery like it was  some sort of a classy American Pie movie.  The Riot Club has excess and debauchery but it goes deeper than that.  there's a slow build up and it tackles how these guys worship money,  power, and how entitle they feel. It's a movie that makes you think and  feel, a visceral kind of emotions, the kind that made me want to get  out of my seat and do something, but I didn't because it's a movie and  it's not really happening, at least not right at that moment.  Film is art and art is perceived differently depending on the time and  the person, I understand that. The movie riled me up and was difficult  to watch, not in a ""it's bad"" kind of way it just got under my skin.  The film was so powerful and clearly done that the worst of the bunch  is first introduced as a sweetheart who I didn't suspect to have such  passion and fire in him however misplaced it may be. A quarter to the  end I was resolved to leave the theater with a bitter taste in my  mouth, a feeling of injustice and I did, but at least it wasn't as  acidic as I taught it would be, it was bittersweet.  The characters are a bit stereotypical but the cast is top notch. Like  I said it's a slow build up and as time pass they get credible and  intense, you're in it living it. Of course some of them take more of  the spotlight (Irons & Claflin) than the others but they were all very  good. The meager female presence is striking, not only because their  beauty in this sausage fest, but the up most talent they showed and how  relatable they were.  The film is deep, clever, brilliant even in how the story is presented,  developed and resolved. When I think back on it, it's the best kind of  negotiations where both parties leave a little disappointed. There is a  side to take in this film but the story stays somewhat neutral."
The Riot Club,"Founded in approximately 1780, the Bullingdon Club were notorious for booking out a restaurant, trashing it beyond recognition and handing the owner a cheque for the damages on the way out. The unofficial club, which still exists today, consists of a select group of male elites at Oxford University and is the inspiration behind the latest cinema release, ""The Riot Club""."
The Riot Club,"The Riot Club begins with the group looking to recruit two new starters, as Alistair (Sam Claflin) and Miles (Max Irons) emerge as possible candidates. However, over the course of a single evening, the club's reputation is put on the line."
The Riot Club,"The film itself is very much an emotional roller-coaster. Initially, there are plenty of laughs to be had, mostly executed through witty one-liners, though it becomes a lot darker with some shocking scenes that make for extremely uncomfortable viewing. It's the latter which highlights the film's superb acting, as the young cast give genuinely convincing performances. Holliday Grainger, who plays Lauren - Miles' love interest, particularly stands out here."
The Riot Club,"Playwright Laura Wade adapted the film from her own play ""Posh"", and it clearly shows, as a large portion of the film is based at the table in the restaurant. While it comes as a slight disappointment that The Riot Club doesn't stray too far from its theatrical origins, it does seem to work in the film's favour, adding to the suspense before the highly dramatic climax."
The Riot Club,"Wade unsubtly incorporates a number of themes in The Riot Club that are reflective of the society we live in, including the inherited privilege and power culture in the country. There's also a lot of political satire, which comes as no surprise considering some of The Bullingdon Club's ex-members include the current British Prime Minister David Cameron, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne and Mayor of London Boris Johnson."
The Riot Club,"Overall, The Riot Club is an excellent play-adaptation that makes for a highly gripping film. There's laughs a plenty, shocks a plenty and a great cast. This is a must-see."
The Riot Club,REVIEW - THE RIOT CLUB
The Riot Club,I have watched many films in my life and many wash over me with no meaning except for a few like I Daniel Blake.
The Riot Club,This film is one of those very rare films that is truly disturbing.
The Riot Club,"The difference between those who have and those who have not, the difference between those born into money and those who earn it."
The Riot Club,"Horrible, disturbing but essential watching reinforcing the image of we look after our own."
The Riot Club,Are the characters in this film true? Do people actually act this way? I will never know and honestly never want to be in the position to find out.
The Riot Club,Rating 10 out of 10
The Riot Club,"They've made an unpleasant film about unpleasant people behaving unpleasantly. Unfortunately, nothing else about The Riot Club is as clean as its tone."
The Riot Club,"The Riot Club is an exclusive ""dining club"" wherein a select group of wealthy and privileged young men at Oxford get together – and have done for a couple of hundred years – ostensibly to dine, but actually to indulge in excess. At one such gathering, things go horribly wrong."
The Riot Club,"A group of up and coming young British actors are excellent in a film which dramatises (and, it can be argued, over-dramatises) an incident from recent years. More than anything else, it is effective at conveying the sense of superiority and entitlement which accompanies some of these upper-class individuals, and the rarified atmosphere of the power base which has surrounded them since birth."
The Riot Club,"Credit goes to Max Irons and, particularly, Sam Claflin as the two main protagonists, and to Laura Wade for the screenplay adapted from her own play. The ending is both so right and so wrong."
The Riot Club,"And for the benefit of any non-Brits watching and reading, the society portrayed here is as alien to most Brits as it is to you."
The Riot Club,"The film is glamorous because it is taking place at Oxford University, among the aristocracy attending there, business, political and real nobility all mixed in one culture, with some representatives of some foreign top society, in this case the one foreign student seems to be Greek. But that is not the point. Just for that very reason we could expect some nobility and some common sense. But these young men, just under or above twenty years of age, are rich and they show it, spoilt and they stink like it in every single gesture of theirs, rotten but not at all like the famous Johnny Rotten who was against the establishment with all his guns, sexual or not. Here they are rotten because they turn their belonging to the top establishment into the most disgusting condescending rejection of all the others accused of being ""the poor."""
The Riot Club,"In other words these young men are plainly filthy. These four qualifying adjectives are the ""subtitle"" of the DVD but they are just right."
The Riot Club,"Let's say this film is the most disgusting aristocratic remake of the famous film Clockwork Orange, but without having the excuse of being rejected, socially discriminated against, uneducated and bored to death by total inactivity, no jobs, no parents, no nothing anyone is supposed to have, including doctors if necessary. The only thing the older Clockwork Orange young men had was the police and prison. But in this film these young aristocratic people have absolutely everything they can dream of and they make it a weapon against hard working people and ordinary citizens because they want to have fun, and for them fun is over-drink, over-eat, insult people, make as much noise as possible, disturb everyone, destroy everything they can, etc. And do not forget their sexism because for them the game is not funny if there is not an escort girl to satisfy all their needs, of course under the belt in this case, for a few hundred pounds."
The Riot Club,"But what makes this film particularly bizarre and hateful is that one culprit will pay for the ten culprits they are, one picked by the police on the presence of some DNA on the weapon used to nearly kill the publican whose pub was trashed by them. The moral lesson from the parents is that they have a good lawyer at their disposal and that everyone can make a mistake and they, the young people, are at college in order to learn how to adapt to any situation, including that basically criminal behavior and action. They, parents and children, are sexists, they are extreme segregationists against the poor, they are disrespectful of anything, sacred or not. And among these ten people one will be Prime Minister one day and all of them will be MPs or Lords (since some are from hereditary noble families carrying the position of Lord) or ministers, with maybe one or two who will prefer hiding away at Oxford university as dons overlooking the next generation of noble hooligans."
The Riot Club,"The picture is absolutely sickening and unbearable. If you can survive watching such young people full of trash trashing the society that is providing them with more money they need and can use, you may then understand why we have to get rid of the House of Lords and of these universities who excuse nine culprits because their parents can provide a lot of money. Here the rot is not in the sons of this aristocracy but in the university institution and the social establishment that are behind. This society needs some good cleansing. Where is Hercules, by Jove?"
The Riot Club,Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
The Riot Club,"A group of young men in an Oxford society that is a thinly-disguised Bullingdon recruit new members and set in train their initiations and various japes. This culminates in a welcome party that skips from debauchery into Dionysian rage. The two new recruits are an odd couple, a kind of good snob/bad snob pairing who share a tutorial and have facile arguments along Tory/Labour lines. The problem with all the chundering and punting antics of these spoiled clowns is that it is too easy a target. The Riot Club wields too blunt a scalpel to be incisive social commentary. And it just isn't funny or bizarre enough to be biting satire. The ten members all seem to flounce around in a similar fashion and become indistinguishable from each other. Thank the stars one was Greek which allowed for a degree of differentiation. Live long enough in the UK and you will come across arid, prickly Oxbridge graduates with their insular sneering and extensive on-parade vocabulary. They form a particular insidious tribe in UK society and the system of boarding schools and privilege that breeds them is ripe for excoriation. Unfortunately, this film takes aim and misses by a ridiculous mile."
The Riot Club,"Before watching the movie, I would suggest to read a little bit about the Bullingdon Club, which this movie is based on. It's always better to watch a movie with a little bit of context."
The Riot Club,"That said, the writer, Laura Wade, explores some very complex issues regarding wealth and peer pressure. While these themes have been depicted in movies over and over again, she does not imply that the entire upper class is a bunch of arrogant pricks, who think they can buy their way out of everything. Clearly, they can, you can't really fault them for that, but the Riot Club is not inherently an evil society. They are rich, they drink, and they sometimes lose control, as we all do. The difference is that there are no consequences for them, so they can keep on doing it. I liked how peer pressure was depicted in this film and how the guilt and responsibility of some of the members was shown. It really made me consider how we act in situations we have very little control over and how responsible should we feel in these kinds of situations."
The Riot Club,"My only complaint about the movie would be the main character (Miles Richards) being a flawless Mary Sue - rich, handsome, witty, intelligent, kind and well meaning, as well as some of the other positive characters being presented as these morally superior beings. That felt very strange for a movie, the main idea of which is that not everything is as black and white as it seems, and we all just try to justify our own actions while doing what we feel (not think) is best."
The Riot Club,"A cast of outstanding young British actors all acting superbly, together with several very fine, and already established character players, a 'name' director and a successful West End play so why isn't ""The Riot Club"" more engaging than it is? Probably because there's very little on the screen to like. ""The Riot Club"" is said to be very loosely based on the real life Bullingdon Club and is about a group of thoroughly unpleasant, extremely rich young men at Oxford, members of the club of the title, who have dedicated themselves to decadence and debauchery and really just being absolute shits."
The Riot Club,"It's very well done though I'm not sure it tells us very much about the state of the nation that we didn't already know. All this movie really does is reinforce an already held belief that being stinking rich is basically tantamount to being totally objectionable and getting away with it. It's a hateful picture but a hatefully compelling one, nevertheless."
The Riot Club,The decline of the middle class and the over-power of the rentier class is the big issue of our time.
The Riot Club,This movie gets nowhere near it.
The Riot Club,"We are given no idea why these people are so privileged, the characters are simply not dominant (especially the president), and overall it feels like an intra-class conflict - the little people hating on each other - with the bad little people in fancy dress."
The Riot Club,"At the least it had to deliver grotesqueries, but not a bit. Not even humour. Not even an insight on why the dominance is pleasurable. The sex theme is so prissy, and the climax is just a banal beating in a banal location. Then a really flat moral outcome."
The Riot Club,Another failure for British film making.
The Riot Club,"I saw this film at the 2014 Toronto Film Fest and it was the standout in a lineup that included such excellent fare as NIGHTCRAWLERS and WHO AM I - NO SYSTEM IS SAFE. I saw all three on the same weekend, and a couple of days later it was clear that RIOT was the one that lingered. It's an impressive stage adaptation that adds both an effective opening act and an epilogue with a real sting. This while not letting the central event -- an annual hedonistic dinner for the titular club, consisting of the ten most aristocratic, spoiled-rich blue-bloods of Oxford -- bog down with theatrics."
The Riot Club,"The cast is uniformly excellent. You can tell that everybody was really into their part, what with all the wretched excess being enthusiastically depicted. It should be noted that Natalie Dormer's top-billing is misplaced. She's quite good as a call girl who (very astutely) refuses to service these sub-Joffreys, but it's strictly a supporting role. The co-leads are Max Irons and Sam Claflin, who play Oxford freshmen who become the two newest club members."
The Riot Club,"Irons is solid, but when your character's defining characteristic is spinelessness, it's hard to generate a lot of excitement. It's Claflin who gets to shine, playing the worst of the worst, no easy feat! (Sort of like Michael Madsen in RESERVOIR DOGS or Alan Ford in SNATCH in this respect.) Kudos, Sam, for taking it to the limit on loathsomeness and earning a spot on my elite IMDb ""Scum of the Earth All-Star Team,"" alongside such luminaries as Pacino, Freeman, Pitt, Kingsley, Gambon, Plummer, Crowe, Penn, Hopper, Oldman and Spacey."
The Riot Club,"Most dead-on tag line I've heard so far: ""A wakeup call for fans of Downton Abbey."""
The Riot Club,"This is a typical gritty Film Four presentation. A look at the seedier side of society groups and making us look at a side of people that we like to believe doesn't exist really but deep down we know they do. Very gritty , very thought provoking watch this knowing that you will be shocked ."
The Riot Club,A secret Oxford University club where if you have to ask to join you can't be a member who are all from affluent backgrounds and think they are better than anyone beneath their social standing.
The Riot Club,We see how the club begins from its origins to modern day with the group needing new recruits . We see the process and induction of the new members and quickly realise that they are raucous to the extreme. They are preparing to book the annual meal and have to leave Oxford and end up in a beautiful family orientated gastro pub.
The Riot Club,As the drink flows and the drugs are consumed the behaviour of the group becomes excessive. A pre arranged prostitute refuses to co-operate which infuriates the members further.
The Riot Club,A violent assault tests their loyalty to each other and is played out with the involvement of outside parties.
The Riot Club,"Miles and Alistair are a couple of privileged freshmen at Oxford University. Miles becomes romantically involved with a working class student called Lauren, while Alistair has delusions of grandeur and several loose screws. Both are invited to join a club devoted to drunkenness and debauchery, and after enduring some juvenile initiation rites, the two novices join some veteran student hedonists for a bacchanalian feast in a country pub's private dining room."
The Riot Club,"The second half of the film observes the tedious antics of this aristocratic rabble at their interminable blow-out. The spoiled brats exhibit the sophistication of soccer hooligans as they over-indulge in various intoxicants, insult the pub's staff, get rejected by a prostitute and trash the joint. After Alistair lures Lauren to the gathering, the entitled yahoos insult and assault the girl. Unfortunately, the dramatic effect of this pivotal scene is diluted by the scant time previously devoted to Lauren's relationship with Miles, compared to the endless depiction of drunken mayhem. Despite some decent acting, the film misses several opportunities to make a deeper impression as it focuses on the evening's degeneration into an orgy of excess."
The Riot Club,"The film deals with lessons that cannot be learned at school, in the elite of British private societies, where all men are not created not be equal.. The pic is set in both the fantasy and nightmarish aspects of university elites and ends up being terribly violent and with a terrible finale, leaving the viewer breathless for a finale showing no one will ever pay for the terrible facts committed (as a matter of fact more crimes than facts). In the end the guys attitude and behaviour their seeing everything as a commodity, their considering such incidents as ""scrapes,"" leaves the audience (at least it had that impact on myself) with a total lack of hope for the future.. However, regardless of the moral opinions the film is very well acted."
The Riot Club,Gripping in the repulsiveness of its main characters. Not inconceivable that this sort of thing really happens in Britain. Horrific if so. A sort of upper-set Lord Of The Flies.
The Riot Club,"To me, this movie is entertaining with great storyline and acting. That's why I gave a 9 for it. However, I kind of understand why this movie doesn't get very good reviews. Because It was portraying a group of young, rich and stupid people who were behaving so arrogantly and most general (middle class) people who watch it would feel strongly disapproved and, as a consequence dislike this movie. I think it is quite difficult to differentiate the opinion regarding one issue with the movie itself."
The Riot Club,"Even though I also feel disapproved and dislike their behaviors, I can see that this movie is trying to communicate something. I believe they try to show the hideous aspect of UK's elite system that has long been an important part of British society and it has carried on till the modern time. Many people admire and look at the UK as equivalent of being posh and sophisticated especially in those prestigious universities. But in fact, they are likely to do more harm than good. The movie really shows how rich kids and even elite adults can be out of touch with the world and think of themselves as superior than the rest, which I believe there are still many like that in the UK."
The Riot Club,"It gets me thinking that it is probably the culprit that drags the UK behind other countries. The UK is now behind the war-defeated country like Germany and the country of similar size and characteristics such as France, even though it got so many advantages such as speaking the world language, once the most powerful country with so many colony and all. I believe the main difference between France, Germany and UK is that the UK elite system, including the monarch, is so strong and overly important. As an outsider it looks interesting and cool but I wouldn't want the same for my country. I think it is kind of bad for the country in a sense that many resources could have been pulled away for more practical purposes and wasted on the flamboyant parties, fancy clothes and palaces."
The Riot Club,"We will just leave it at that. Started out a lot of fun for the most part but then...we cannot be allowed to have too much of that, right? Not with all the political angst about."
The Riot Club,Some bits are just hard to watch.
The Riot Club,"The film definitely could've been something grander in the hands of someone else. But that doesn't mean it's not worth it, by any means. The screenplay is a bit all over the place, but the acting is particularly fantastic. In particular, I'm talking about Sam Claflin. He's absolutely mesmerizing, in his quiet hatred and resentment and then later on when he's given more dramatic, outer material. I'd always liked him in The hunger Games but here he's truly something else. I'm now officially a fan and I really hope I see him in more things to come in the future, he has a lot of charisma that's really well built in. I think because of him I'm giving the film such a high rating."
The Loft,"I have a couple of questions after watching The Loft. The first one is why some people don't like this movie? If you wanted to watch a mystery thriller then this is what you got. There's no way in hell you could see the end coming. That's what makes a mystery thriller standing out from the rest. A good story with some twists you don't see coming. My second question is why do we need to remake a movie that has been made before and even better? I saw the Belgian version of 2008 before and even if it is the exact copy of this version the original was even better. So why spending all that money on a movie that already exists? Just put some subtitles under the Belgian version and you got an even better movie. Saves you money and time. And if you watched this version of The Loft to see Matthias Schoenaerts play in it than you could have watched the original version as well because he plays in both movies. That must be a premiere I think. Anyways, even though I preferred the original version I still think this one was also good. Good story with good twists and with a good cast. What else do you want on a movie night?"
The Loft,.. a movie that's far more entertaining than most of the crap produced these days.
The Loft,"Really nice acting, cringe-worthy characters (in a good way) played by talented & believable actors with a nice suspenseful/thrilling plot. I honestly thought I would hate it when I started watching it on BluRay, but wow, I sat through it all without even taking a bathroom break."
The Loft,"Not going to spoil anything, except for the fact that this movie is another reason why the so called ""critics"" should not be listened to."
The Loft,Oh and watch it with your wife for the best experience.
The Loft,"The only reason I knew this movie existed is because I was looking up what Eric Stonestreet had done aside from Modern Family, so I decided to give this a shot. The premise of the movie is the best part about it: Five guys have the keys to a secret loft where they can freely cheat on their wives, but one day they find a dead girl on the bed and have to figure out who did it. To this movie's credit, the first half is engaging and curious. They develop some shady history between the guys and show how the loft came to be, but as pieces of the puzzle start coming together and the more answers we get, the more the movie suffers. I mean I've seen botched premises before but The Loft takes it to a new low."
The Loft,"The five leads in this movie do what they can. They are likable actors and they have some moments of conviction here and there, but the script is so horrendous it's astonishing that they can keep a straight face delivering these lines. Wentworth Miller is the weak link, and I don't know if it's his fault or his character just being really weird and uncomfortable but that's another thing: you don't like any of these characters. They're all despicable, cheating, lying, douchebags that are only friends because they all have those sh*tty traits in common. And I use the term ""friends"" loosely because these guys seem to hate each other as much as the audience does. Half the time they're yelling and arguing at each other, the other half they're just dull and plodding along with the script. It's sad because you want to like these guys but they really are just sociopathic dickheads. Honestly the only one with a conscious is James Marsden's character but even then still he's a deceiving slimeball. However the cokehead brother completely embraces the psychosis angle and gives a very nice standout performance considering the material he was given."
The Loft,The women in this movie are horrendous. There is not one memorable female character - they're all either stupid and married to these guys or stupid and f*cking them behind their wives' backs. It's hard to care about a movie where every character is totally unlikable.
The Loft,"Like I said, the first half of the movie is very promising. The pacing was appropriate, it was easy to follow what was going on, it gave you time to become invested in the mystery, then all of a sudden things get crazy. Like unbelievable, ridiculous, stupid levels of crazy. First of all there are like six endings to the movie; it goes on for a good 10-20 more minutes than it should, and the worst part is that each ""ending"" is worse than the last. They try over-explaining what happened and it ends up getting so twisted and convoluted that it collapses onto itself. At a point you just stop caring about who did what - you just want the damn movie to end. The entire third act is a disaster in every conceivable way."
The Loft,"This movie was watchable, mainly because of the cast, but the ending is so frustrating I had to give it a low score. I really tried to like it, it's just hard to care about a movie when you're just watching a bunch of stupid people do stupid things. And the police interrogation scenes were atrocious."
The Loft,"If you don't care about plot and just want to see a bunch of good looking people act like complete jerks for an hour and a half, you can get a kick out of The Loft. If you want a thrilling murder mystery that makes you think, stay far far away - The Loft does not deliver."
The Loft,"""The Loft"" is a remake of a Belgian film, and focuses on five married men who go in on a ritzy high rise loft for the purposes of pursuing their affairs and sexual escapades. When a girl winds up dead in a pool of blood in the loft, the five men panic as they attempt to unravel who she is and where she came from."
The Loft,"Taking some cues from Hitchcock (and not exactly with a fraction of Hitch's poise), ""The Loft"" is an overall entertaining film, but the script at times is the equivalent of a cheap Rubik's cube— it looks fine, it's a fun puzzle, I guess, but it's really just not that impressive overall."
The Loft,"The film shifts between past and present, unraveling the narrative through flashbacks which are sandwiched between the current dilemma of the four men arguing in the loft over the corpse of the dead blonde. The pacing is a bit choppy, and the transitions rather abrupt. James Marsden and Wentworth Miller are among the film's greatest star power here, but the cast overall is really underwhelming, and the performances are at times borderline campy as the men play up their roles as buffoonish plutocratic mattress hounds."
The Loft,"The finale cements my feelings of the film as an underwhelming thriller that seems more suited for television than the silver screen, but I still can't say it was totally not worth the time. In spite of the hammy performances, the disjointed narrative, and the overall sensibility of utter lifelessness that the film has, it is still by and large an entertaining flick. Nearly impossible to take seriously, but for entertainment's sake, it's passable. 5/10."
The Loft,"From the opening moments of 'The Loft' you can guess pretty much exactly what you're in for. A ""whodunnit"" mystery with plentiful twists, where not everything is as it seems. Knowing that much doesn't hurt a film at all. In fact it makes the next couple of hours something to be very much looked forward to - or at least for me it does. You could say the format of the genre is lacking in originality, but you could rarely say two films are the same and anyone who says they saw the ending coming is almost always lying or exaggerating a fleeting suspicious they had. This is why I love mystery-thrillers."
The Loft,"'The Loft' is a fun watch - nothing more, nothing less. It achieves exactly what it sets out to. The 5 lead actors were all pretty solid and gave credible performances. I think I will always see Eric Stonestreet as his brilliant character from 'Modern Family', so I struggled a bit at first to take him seriously in his role here, but he's good enough of an actor to get past that. The dialogue was tightly written and every detail that could otherwise have been questioned was covered well. The only fault I could find was the score sometimes drowning out the dialogue which can be annoying in a film like this where you are trying to catch every spoken detail. Altogether though a fine movie."
The Loft,"The architect Vincent Stevens (Karl Urban); the psychiatrist Chris Vanowen (James Marsden); the real estate agents Luke Seacord (Wentworth Miller) and Marty Landry (Eric Stonestreet); and Chris' half-brother Philip Trauner (Matthias Schoenaerts) are married and best friends. Vincent proposes his friends to share a wonderful penthouse loft in a brand new building designed by him to become their rendezvous instead of using their credit cards for love affairs and one night stands in hotels. When they discover the body of a beautiful woman cuffed on the bed in the loft, they have argument to find who is the responsible and secrets are disclosed affecting their friendship."
The Loft,"""The Loft"" is an engaging thriller with a good story with many twists despite of the flaws and the weak conclusion. It is not easy to write a complex screenplay developing many characters with twists without plot holes. The greatest one is how a high-standard building in the present days does not have security cameras and guards to show that the alibis are not consistent? Chris is a psychiatrist and does not identify that Sarah Deakins is not dead? The conclusion is also unconvincing. My vote is six."
The Loft,"Title (Brazil): ""Prazeres Mortais"" (""Deadly Pleasures"")"
The Loft,"The movie started nicely,, with flipping between the moment of now in the investigation room and the moment where they found the body in the loft and the one year and between flashbacks .. Even though it had five different stories it was actually easily understandable."
The Loft,"The Idea of the movie is fresh and new for Hollywood and the plot flows smoothly in the first half an hour of the movie there are no much puzzles to think about but who really between those five guys did it !! until you start to think maybe it's one of the guys mistresses. then you jump to accuse everyone who speaks Latin, then everyone becomes a killer in your eyes :D ."
The Loft,So to be fair the screenplay writing appears so tight and consistent .. with just a couple of unexpected surprise in the end ;)
The Loft,With the same director as the Belgian version of the movie Erik Van Looy and pretty much the same writers i'v heard they kept it just as it went in the original. Even though i kinda preferred to watch the original movie because the originals always better but i mean who can stand almost 2 hours of translated Dutch movie !! :P
The Loft,"As for the cast, the Leads whom i only know from TV they were all engaging and well invested in their roles, Karl Urban, James Marsden, Wentworth Miller and Eric Stonestreet and even the short appearances of Matthias Schoenaerts who was actually in the original Belgian movie ""Loft (2008)""."
The Loft,"Overall it went fine,, well at least let's say better than what i'v read in some reviews ."
The Loft,"Architect Vincent Stevens (Karl Urban) is being interrogated by the police as he recounts what happened. Luke Seacord (Wentworth Miller) had discovered a dead girl handcuffed to the bed in the loft. He called Vincent, psychiatrist Chris Vanowen (James Marsden), fellow real estate agent Marty Landry (Eric Stonestreet), and Chris' half brother Philip Williams (Matthias Schoenaerts). Vincent had organized a shared secret love nest for the five married friends. Chris is married to Allison (Rhona Mitra) and had an affair with Ann Morris (Rachael Taylor), the sister of a patient who committed suicide. Vincent is married to Barbara (Valerie Cruz) and slept with Sarah Deakins (Isabel Lucas)."
The Loft,"None of the characters are appealing and therefore none of it matters to me. By following a scattering of characters, none of them become big enough to be compelling. It becomes an endurance contest of waiting for the reveal. Since nobody is the hero of the piece, anybody could be the killer and no twist or reveal is truly shocking. I had hopes of a Hitchcockian thriller but it's all very flat."
The Loft,"We have five men, all approaching middle-age and hungering for their inconsequential days of drinking and screwing anything in sight. They are Vince (Karl Urban), a married architect, Luke (Wentworth Miller), a married diabetic who finds himself going along with his friends more often than not, Chris (James Marsden), a married psychiatrist, Marty (Eric Stonestreet), a married, loudmouth alcoholic, and Phillip (Matthias Schoenaerts), Chris's married half-brother. In efforts to try and replicate those days, Vince gives each of his pals a key to a loft in a building he designed. There are only five keys made for this particular room, which mimics the design of a lavish presidential suite. Here, the men can unleash their wildest fantasies and never worry about getting caught. It isn't until Luke ventures up to the loft to find a nude woman murdered and handcuffed to the bed of the loft that things begin to unravel. With this, the men begin to reveal to each other, and their spouses, their intentions and their ugly path of adultery."
The Loft,"I'm always up for a good erotic thriller and Erik Van Looy's The Loft is serviceable genre-fare, by that standard. Van Looy apparently felt the story was significant enough to warrant a Dutch-language, Belgian adaptation in 2008 before working on this American version in 2011. Despite being shot in the summer of 2011, the film went through a shift in distributors when the head of Dark Castle Entertainment at Warner Bros. moved offices to Universal. After that, he sat on the film, choosing to release other projects and keep The Loft on the shelf until releasing it with minimal promotion during the dumping ground month of January 2015 in America."
The Loft,"On that basis alone, in addition to being an erotic thriller, a generally tough sell, the American version of The Loft is destined to bear some obscurity in future years. However, what makes this genre work is the elements of sexiness and contempt, which this film has in mass amounts. The erotic flare in Nicolas Karakatsanis's cinematography, heavy on the lavish details and the red textures, and John Frizzell's equal parts sensual and ominous score really make The Loft work for its genre. The contempt element comes in when we realize just how unlikable all of the characters are here. When we are lead down a path of twists and turns, most of which clearly written by the writing team of Bart De Pauw and Wesley Strick, it's clear we cannot trust any of these characters and that makes the experience that much more intriguing."
The Loft,"The Loft, however, has its own share of shortcomings, most of which come in the acting department. Without a doubt, for a mainstream release, this has some of the shakiest acting I have seen in quite sometime. James Marsden constantly feels awkward, giving a deer-in-headlights-esque performance throughout the entire film. His lines delivery carries a certain wooden quality, and isn't assisted by the likes of Urban or Miller, both of whom have their own share of overacting as well. Probably the film's most animated is Stonestreet, given his roly-poly nature, but the acting here brings the film down significant notches, especially in the more climactic sequences."
The Loft,"Furthermore, the downside of there being no likable characters makes it inevitably difficult to care what happens to anyone by the end of the film. While the element of distrust works wonders for the ability to resonate with characters in a film, it makes the outcome less impacting because you find yourself not rooting for anyone in the long run - not even an antihero but a series of unreliable, contemptible souls."
The Loft,"The Loft takes an underrated territory that finds itself charted less and less in the current day and tries to invoke it with some sort of life and substance. While it succeeds aesthetically, it's disappointing on a character level and on an acting level as well. The efforts to get this film a release in America likely wasn't worth the laborious process and the agonizing wait for a release."
The Loft,"Starring: James Marsden, Karl Urban, Wentworth Miller, Eric Stonestreet, Matthias Schoenaerts, Isabel Lucas, Rhona Mitra, and Rachael Taylor."
The Loft,"All of the characters are sleezebags and/or stupid. The hooker with the heart of gold, the five cheating frenemies, the stupid, clingy, unhappy wives, the dumb sleezy pickup artist who was stupid enough to think some rich guy was going to leave his wife for her."
The Loft,"Dumb, dumb, dumb...let me count the ways..."
The Loft,"1. You don't try to stage a dead body after 10 hours or so...there's something called lividity, which means the blood has pooled, so when you find a body lying on its back and you turn it over on its stomach, the coroner, unless, he or she is as stupid as you are, is going to figure out this dead body, which when it was alive supposedly committed suicide, didn't."
The Loft,"2. See above. this also goes along with cutting it's wrist after the fact. The body was already dead, dummy, just leave it as it was. Don't cut it's wrists and hack it up. Again, forensics will determine the blood flow, that the heart wasn't pumping, that the blood is old, blood splatter, etc. Remember you are trying to make this a suicide - not a murder by a butcher who hung around to do more damage to a dead body long after the fact."
The Loft,"3. She was dead and left a suicide note, why did you have to do anything with the body???"
The Loft,"4. If you are going to kill someone with an injection, don't do it in their arm, put a spot where the sun don't shine and hope a thorough examination doesn't find the injection spot."
The Loft,"5. After moving a dead body after it's been dead for hour, sob all over it and leave your freaking DNA, skin, and haircells, why don't you . We already know your stupid."
The Loft,"6. How do you still have a key to a crime scene, where you and the actual murderer could get in? Wouldn't the cops change the locks and secure it would more than tape, confiscate the keys???"
The Loft,"7. A murderer decides to explain everything to a guy wearing a coat, has a cellphone and possibly a wire??? Really bad film-making and writing."
The Loft,"8. Why trust a coke-head, out of control moron to cover up the crime? What did you expect a nut-job like him would do? Why didn't you recognize the problem after the fact either? Isn't one of you idiots supposed to be a doctor, haven't you watched The Forensic Files, Law & Order, any cop show??? Ever heard of DNA??? See #1 and 2 above"
The Loft,"9. You're all liars and cheaters, why would *any* of you trust the other guy???"
The Loft,"10. The character with the supposed moral compass (he's shtupping the hooker) is as sleazy as the rest of them. Please don't attempt to make it the good guy. He's cheating on his wife and kids. Really? Did he think he was just going to have a cup of coffee with a woman who told him she wasn't wearing a panties in public? He resisted her ""charms"" for, what, like 10 seconds?"
The Loft,11. The hooker with the heart of gold...really?
The Loft,"12. Is that ending supposed to be upbeat? Get her tested for STDs man. Millions of women in the world, you're bored with your wife, and you pick a hooker?"
The Loft,"13. Why aren't they all going on trial or in jail for obstruction of justice and abuse of a corpse, lying to the police, and any number of broken laws?"
The Loft,"Stupid writing, stupid direction, stupid acting. Bad, just really bad, so bad, I had to sign in just to write how bad."
The Loft,"And everyone looked unshaven, greasy, smelly, and like they needed a good bath. How anyone wanted to sleep with any of them for money or not is beyond me. Ewww..."
The Loft,Greetings from Lithuania.
The Loft,"""The Loft"" (2014) is definitely an enjoyable mystery flick. It tells a story of 5 guys who rent an loft, when something bad one day happens. Trust no one, when you have these kind of friends."
The Loft,"The story was not bad at all, i likes the simple yet somehow fresh idea. Pacin of this movie is good, at running time 1 h 45 min this movie barely drags and is entertaining from start till finish."
The Loft,"Overall, ""The Loft"" is a satisfying mystery thriller - ""who dunnit"". Perfromances are very OK, but nothing that very good. Script is interesting. This movie doesn't go deep into conciseness of these guys, but it's enjoyable ride nevertheless."
The Loft,"I never really fancied seeing The Loft because from what I saw on the trailers it didn't really look to be anything that good. It was my wife who wanted to see it, so I thought I'd give it a try, and I was quite surprised as it ended up being a decent enough thriller. I mean it wasn't anything spectacular, but it was worth watching."
The Loft,"The story is quite basic on the surface...a group of married guys buy a loft apartment to use for their, shall we say, intimate adventures with other women, but when one of the men finds a woman dead handcuffed to the bed things start to go downhill quickly."
The Loft,"Is it an amazing story? Not in the slightest, but what keeps it interesting are all the wee twists and turns the story has with the main one at the end. Is it a gripping story? No, but it still does enough to keep your interest."
The Loft,"I'm also surprised to see other reviewers mention that the film was very slow paced as I didn't find that at all. It moves along at a steady enough pace without ever getting boring, so where the ""very slow movie"" part comes into it I'm not sure."
The Loft,"The cast is pretty decent, and I'm glad to say that Wentworth Miller was at least MUCH better here than when I saw him last which was in Resident Evil: Afterlife. Even though his facial expression always stayed the same with that permanent frown (I think he's incapable of any other expression when acting in all honesty) at least his acting was better this time around. As for the characters they all play, well, apart from one or two, none are really all that likable, including the female roles, so you kind of end up not caring what happens to any of them."
The Loft,"Anyway, The Loft does have it's moments, and overall it is a watchable thriller, but it's really nothing to get too excited about."
The Loft,"The Loft is a murder mystery, directed by Erik Van Looy who also happened to direct the original Belgium film (loft) 2008. This remake follows the same story of five uncommitted husbands who struggle to sustain a relationship and to keep it in their pants. They are conveniently given access to a secret love dungeon where they can seek their mistresses and cheat on their wives. Shortly after somebody is ""murdered"" in the loft, the five begin to suspect each other and from there on the over complex CSI episode arises."
The Loft,"Ill start off praising the positives, since the film did have potential. The cinematography is miraculous. The unique sense of direction makes every shot look great. The script is somewhat lethargic but thankfully the ""majority"" of the cast pull it off. Each character was evenly distributed and explored, creating fairly interesting protagonists and slight emotional attachment. The score raised tension when necessary and kept me guessing on the edge of my seat. But after the 100th twist, the suspense and fascination quickly dissolved. The loft has simply out smarted itself, a simple, yet at times intriguing plot desperately seeks for every twist and turn it can find and uses them, I don't even think M. Night Shyamalan could've handled it. Things started to drag and seem all over the place. It is one big puzzle with one too many pieces. Overall a fun, entertaining sexual thriller. Nothing more, nothing less."
The Loft,"It confuses me why some great movies like this have subpar ratings and others are completely overrated. Of all the boring Saturday movies I've watched on Netflix, this one remains my favorite. It's best to go into this movie knowing as little as possible. If you love thrillers and ""who did it"" type movies, this will be a satisfying movie to you. I've read some complaints about the ending, but I disagree. The ending was fairly realistic, and that made it satisfying to me. It's not an Oscar worthy movie, but it's a good guilty pleasure movie, especially for a Netflix day."
The Loft,"Having seen the original movie 'Loft' by Erik Van Looy (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0926762/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1), I was hoping for a fresh take. But a fresh take is obviously not why they hired the same Van Looy to direct this version. This is essentially the same movie, just without subtitles."
The Loft,"In short, the building blocks of 'The Loft' are a set of plot twists. They are mostly silly, suffering from a few red herrings that hurt the story's credibility, but it's still entertaining to watch them unfold. Largely because the movie flows well for the most part, with only a few dull moments in the first half."
The Loft,"Although I preferred the exterior design of the original loft, the overall cinematography of 'The Loft' feels a little warmer and more comfortable. Only a little though, because the characters in it are stone cold. James Marsden is the warmest character in the frame, but like everybody else he doesn't get enough to work with to make for a convincing character that the audience can identify with. The characters are The Loft's biggest flaw (as they were in the original), which is especially disappointing since making you care about characters has often been a strong and successful focus in Bart de Pauw's earlier scripts. There are just too many of them, and as a consequence most of the dialog in the back story scenes is expositional and feels awkward. There's never an opportunity for development. The characters are just there to lead you from one twist to the next."
The Loft,"The overall acting suffers as a result. Strangely I felt that Rhona Mitra, with barely any screen time, delivers one of the better performances, with obvious anger below her coldness, yet just enough restrain. Wentworth Miller does what he does best. He doesn't seem to care much, but still feels like a good fit, even with the little information we get for his character. Matthias Schoenaerts' presence is undeniable. But as a guy who seems to be on edge pretty much all the time, his marriage seems plainly unlikely, and his past couldn't be revealed more clumsily. Still, he's a welcome contrast to the otherwise held back main cast. It's a pity that he was clearly suffering from sickness or fatigue in a few scenes, where it's blatantly obvious how much he had to strain his voice. It's arguably suiting his character, but it's still distracting."
The Loft,"The concept of this story lends itself to a much darker movie, and this just feels like a missed opportunity. I can't help but wonder how this would've worked as a film noir. You have five characters that could easily be despicable and instantly more interesting, and the women couldn't be more fatale. Of course, film noir doesn't sell anymore, so instead we get a bright and shiny thriller that doesn't thrill, that keeps you guessing, but doesn't make you ask questions. It deals with edgy themes, but it barely skims them and focuses on polish instead."
The Loft,"7/10. It's definitely an enjoyable watch, but only for people who're into the whole whodunit thing. Not if you're looking for anything more. It's successful at what it is and doesn't pretend to be anything else, but I can't help but sense the potential for something more."
The Loft,A superb tense dark thriller with a great cast n brilliant likeable n believable characters.
The Loft,It runs smooth n slick n is packed with twists n suspense n will keep you on your toes.
The Loft,An excellent unpredictable twisted ending that I did not see coming.
The Loft,"I highly recommend this movie especially if you like suspense, tension n excellent who done it thrillers. Really amazing dark thrill seeking movie with a totally unexpected ending."
The Loft,"I saw ""The Loft"", starring Karl Urban-Bones in the new Star Trek movies, Xena:Warrior Princess_tv; James Marsden-Cyclops in the X-Men movies, The Notebook; Wentworth Miller-Resident Evil:Afterlife, Prison Break_tv; Eric Stonestreet-Modern Family_tv, Identity Thief and Rachael Taylor-666 Park Avenue_tv, Transformers."
The Loft,"This is a pretty good thriller that is a remake of a 2008 Belgian movie, which was then remade in 2010 by the Dutch. Karl plays an architect that makes his best buddies an offer they find hard to resist. He gives each of them a special key to a penthouse loft-aka an apartment-that they may use anytime they feel the need for an extramarital affair or if they just want some quiet time away from their wife or boss. James is a psychiatrist, Wentworth is a shy and quiet one and Eric is a womanizing flirt. All are also married, but with different degrees of happiness. James and Wentworth resist, at first, but soon find a reason to use the loft. One day, Wentworth drops by and finds a dead body in the loft, so he calls everyone and they all put their heads together to figure out exactly what happened. The keys are electronic and need a master key to make a duplicate, which is under lock in Karl's safe-someone had to have gotten in with a key to commit the crime. Did anyone loose their key? Or lend it to someone? Did one or more of the wives discover what the boys are doing at the loft and seek some kind of revenge? Rachael plays a woman that James falls in love with, after meeting her at a party, and no, she is not the victim. It has a lot of good twists and turns in it and I really enjoyed it. It's rated ""R"" for violence, language, sexual content-including nudity- and drug use and has a running time of 1 hour & 48 minutes. I would buy this on Blu-Ray."
The Loft,"A film you just wish someone like David Fincher tackled, The Loft is a B grade movie through and through and a movie that makes no illusions to what it is and Erik Van Looy's English language remake of his original foreign thriller of the same name is a movie that despite its quite obvious flaws and sometimes downright weird acting turns is an enjoyable guilty pleasure that for all sakes and purposes shouldn't be as watchable as it is."
The Loft,"This above statement is by no means a glowing recommendation however, as The Loft is quite frequently a terrible movie that is saved by a plot line so unbelievable yet bewilderingly intriguing that you can't help but watch and try figure out who's done what, who's betrayed who and who can be a bigger bigot than the next guy. It's clear that this material was enough for Van Looy's original film to be well regarded and without having seen it, it was likely less sowed into B grade fodder than this long shelved Hollywood remake that was filmed in 2011 yet only released this year and perhaps the companies behind this redoing clued onto the films biggest flaw, the un-likability of EVERY single character in the film."
The Loft,"This above statement is supposed to be taken literally as all jokes aside, The Loft just might well be the most terrible ensemble committed to screen in many moons. When reading through the name cast of Karl Urban, James Marsden and yes Modern Family's lovable blob Eric Stonestreet you may think this is a strange statement to make and the actors aren't movie ruining horrible (even though Prison Break's Wentworth Miller try's his hardest to be) but there characters sure are."
The Loft,How much can we really relate to a bunch of guys that get together to co-own a seedy city loft apartment where they're free to do anything to anyone at any time and when this crew of calculating derelicts share screen time the cringe factor goes up to almost unbearable levels and by the film's final act you'll soon come to realise that the films reveal isn't all it was cracked up to be from such a loaded plot driver.
The Loft,"For all intents and purposes The Loft is a lot more entertaining than it has any right to be but that is almost entirely due to its mysterious lifeless body that puts our creepy bunch of males into a sticky predicament and take away that and concentration towards the films ""twist"", script and characters unearths a film that should be a whole new league of worse than it actually is. Watch for the could've been factor not the what is factor."
The Loft,2 creepy friends out of 5
The Loft,"After sitting unreleased and collecting dust for three and a half years (and currently sitting at a rock bottom 0% on rottentomatoes) this sleazy, wannabe thriller wasn't worth the wait. The trailer looked intriguing to me, but the film is filled with repulsive characters (one is a coked-out rapist, another is a slimeball who makes it public that he wants to bang his ""friend""'s kid sister, another is a closet homosexual who secretly films his ""friend"" banging random girls in the loft - why would any of these people associate with each other in the first place?) and a screenplay with a new twist in nearly every scene, which merely becomes over complicated and far too confusing after the second twist. After that, I didn't even care who the killer was, or why."
The Loft,"There is absolutely no structure to this film, it's not told in even remotely linear fashion, and the first scene gives away parts of the ending, making the climax partially predictable."
The Loft,"Not even good in a turn-your-mind-off-and-enjoy-it type of way, just over-plotted and sleazy. And do any of these guys ever shave? Not every guy can pull off the five o'clock shadow look."
The Loft,"Filmmakers tried for a deep and meaningful, profound closing scene, and failed miserably."
The Loft,"I was surprised how good this film was. I usually figure out who done its before the reveal but I didn't with this one. It can be a bit confusing jumping around from past and present but that adds to the mystery. Its a smart movie and we don't get those that often. Performances are good- most actors seemed to be a bit out of their typical roles. Wentworth Miller was very different from Prison Break and its nice to see Karl Urban break away from SciFi/Fantasy franchises. Eric Stonestreet was very different from his TV role and James Mardsen showed the conflict of someone going against their norm. Also, it was nice to have a movie this length- not so long its hard to stand up when the film is done. Its a shame the studio didn't really back it and do any advertising. I never saw a TV spot- just a preview. They also kept pushing back the release date. Its a shame this one will just probably fade into DVD obscurity because its good and entertaining."
The Loft,"""The Loft"" is Erik van Looy's first film as a director since 2008. This film may stay his most known work for many years to come as this is already the third version of it. Van Looy directed the Belgian original in 2008 and there was even a Dutch version not much later with another director though. It would certainly very interesting to compare these movies and look for similarities and differences. A third remake is not common at all. He has worked on several Belgian movies and the most famous actor he directed so far is probably Oscar nominee Mickey Rourke. The story is fairly simple initially. Five males rent a loft, which they use to cheat on their wives. One day, a dead woman is found in the apartment and it has to be one of them who killed her as nobody has a key except the five and there are no traces of a breaking and entering."
The Loft,"Quite a simple premise and I think if they had kept it more simple towards the end, it could have been a really great film. In my opinion, it was just one final twist too many at the end. It wasn't so bad that it would destroy the entire film. The big advantage for me here was that I was familiar with the whole quintet. I knew all of them at least a bit from the name or from previous projects and Eric Stonestreet I even knew very well being an avid ""Modern Family"" viewer. A bit strange to see him as such an extremely heterosexual character. Apart from him, I watched some ""Prison Break"", ""Rust and Bone"", ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""30 Rock"" in the past, which helped me associate with the other actors. Urban I was not too familiar with, but I saw him in ""RED"" not too long ago and managed to make a connection here as well. The only other I knew in here was Rhona Mitra, not a particularly versatile actress in my opinion, but she has great screen presence in pretty much everything she is in, even if she doesn't talk much."
The Loft,"Except the criticism about the ending (it felt like a series of ""Pretty Little Liars"" packed into half an hour, framing, suicide, murder, pills...) , I am mostly fine with the script. I think they could have made it more efficient by keeping the film at 80 minutes and having the audience guess until the final sequence who killed the girl and made it very clear with one of them being the killer, maybe even letting him get away at the end. Unfortunately they did not. However, there are some nice details in the movie that I enjoyed. For example, due to the central characters' involvement with several blondes it is initially not safe to say who is the actual victim. I liked that. Guessing is always good. What I did not entirely understand was why most of the other men would rent the loft if it was almost exclusively only one of them who would use it to cheat on his wife. The whole surveillance plot could have been a bit more clever too. As I said earlier, it was almost too much drama packed into 20 minutes and it would have been too much for 2 hours, everything that happened in the end."
The Loft,"All in all, I would slightly recommend this movie. Even if it is not entirely convincing, it certainly has its strengths and you could give it a chance, especially if you like thrillers revolving around murder."
The Loft,"This is one of those mystery movie that tries to go in a realistic tone but ends up being over the top and ridiculous. It's not a bad mystery thriller but isn't one of the really good ones either. It actually had my attention at least from beginning to end. Although I wasn't highly entertained or found this flick to be thrilling or impactful. But it has some hot girls and a decent but a bit of a far-fetched climax that makes it worth a watch with a couple of friends. The ending is pretty generic though and doesn't give off a lasting impression. As a matter of fact this is a mystery movie that will be forgotten in just few days. Overall it's a mystery thriller without much thrills, it's a who done it flick that is just passable."
The Loft,6/10
The Loft,"The loft is a mind boggling thriller about five men who share a loft, where they will sometimes take women up there and cheat on their wives. One thing I'd like to say is that I got angry a lot throughout this movie just because of the animal like behavior of the sick men in this movie. There are like 2 characters in this movie that are clean and not adulterous, lying, cheating filthy people. Having that said, I liked the casting and I thought that every actor did their best to represent their role. James Marsden, Wentworth Miller, Karl urban, and Eric stonestreet all did a pretty good job. This thriller does have a somewhat surprising twist ending, which I always love and then just when you think you have everything all figured out, something else surprising occurs. I also don't think the movie was too short or too long, I think it had a suitable runtime. If you like entertaining mind boggling thrillers, then the loft is for you. It certainly could've been better, but I don't think it deserves all the hate that it's gotten. 7/10 for The Loft."
The Loft,". . . for the Amoral, Sociopathic, Lawless, Cheating Murderers that they are. THE LOFT is bound to do even better business internationally than in the domestic market, since it confirms what the World has long suspected. Big Money people--such as real estate moguls, their bribed government lackeys, their corrupt builders, sleazy architects, Dr. Feel Good psychiatrists, and Big League hookers pictured here--squander the life blood cash that they've stolen from we ""Little People"" (through their fraudulent tax schemes, price-fixing, and exorbitant fees) so that they can lead hedonistic lives featuring every sort of debauchery known to Satan's minions. THE LOFT captures it all: deviant sex, prescription drug abuse, perverse spouse swapping, Big Brother spy cameras, cocaine by the pound, and kinky back-stabbing ""friendships"" (since the Rich are incapable of basic human virtues such as loyalty, benevolence, and trust). THE LOFT proves that the One Per Cent's bonfire of vanities will consume any moth drawn too close to their flame. THE LOFT could be subtitled DEMONS AMONG US."
The Loft,"Great story line, keeps you guessing til the last 20 minutes.
good acting and direction, copper bottom hit!"
The Loft,"5 pals buy an apartment, and come across a dead woman, but none of them own up to it, so its a story going back and forth in an attempt to find the killer!!
well worth a watch, novel idea, good movie,"
Big Game,"In 2010 Jalmari Helander delivered one of the oddest but simultaneously most ingenious and refreshing horror movies of the new millennium with ""Rare Exports"". The success of that film was clearly big enough for him to get noticed in Hollywood and take a shot at making a large-budgeted blockbuster with A-listed actors. We see this happening a lot, by the way: young and creative non-American directors are plucked from their native countries after barely one hit and lured to Hollywood where their careers usually obstruct quickly because they are only allowed to direct lame remakes. But this is where it differs with Helander! Instead of going to Hollyood, Helander brought Hollywood to his beloved Finland for what is one of the most enjoyable, straightforward and unscrupulous action/adventure movies of the '10s. The story is simple yet delightfully far-fetched and over-the-top: 13-year-old Oskari is in the middle of performing a traditional Finnish manhood ritual when Air Force One gets shot out of the air on its way to Helsinki and crash-lands near the boy's hunting turf. Oskari rescues President William Alan Moore from his escape pod and swears to guide him back to civilization before his assailants find him and finish the job. ""Big Game"" has a couple of strong trumps, namely the chemistry between young Finnish actor Onni Tommila and veteran actor Samuel L. Jackson (in another fresh and surprising choice of role), the magnificently breath-taking Finnish filming locations (although largely filmed in Germany) and the purity of the screenplay. I love how Helander doesn't dive too much into themes like terrorism or overly convoluted conspiracy theories but opted for good old-fashioned and pulpy spectacle. Jackson's portrayal of the US President is also phenomenal. They are basically after him because he's an indecisive and cowardly leader. President Moore's toughest anecdote is a story about urinating in his pants and, in a way, undergoing the bravery ritual is as relevant to him as it is to Oskari. Obviously, there are several flaws in ""Big Game"" as well, notably how quickly everything and everybody gets tracked in these supposedly giant and impenetrable forests, but you'll gladly accept them. Thanks to the fast pacing, the compact running time and the thrilling special effects, ""Big Game"" is a massively enjoyable popcorn action flick that comes with my highest recommendation."
Big Game,"The plot elements here can get quite ridiculous, yet I thought the movie was still entertaining, as it's laced with tongue-in-cheek humor and some good performances."
Big Game,"Samuel L. Jackson gives his usual solid performance as American President William Alan Moore, who's on his way to a G-8 conference in Helsinki. However, Air Force One and its fighter jets escort come under attack from surface-to-air missiles, and with the planes defense mechanisms deliberately disarmed President Moore will be forced to evoke an emergency evacuation plan over the wilderness of Finland."
Big Game,"At the same time a 13-year-old Finnish lad, Oskari, has been sent alone into the same wilderness by his father Tapio (Jorma Tommila), and other elders, to prove his manhood by hunting and returning with a slain animal. Onni Tomilla (the real life son of Jorma) is terrific as Oskari, and he often ""steals the show"" here, as he finds himself in the middle of a terrorist plot to capture and eventually kill President Moore."
Big Game,"The fine actor Ray Stevenson is believable here as a turncoat Secret Service Agent. Also, Mehmet Kurtulus is credible as the psychopath, who regards himself as a big game hunter who wants to capture the President, and then after humiliating him on social media intends to have him stuffed and mounted by a taxidermist."
Big Game,"All in all, if you don't take this movie, ably written and directed by Finnish filmmaker Jalmari Helander, too seriously it can be an entertaining flick. There's also a twist at the end which I thought worked rather well."
Big Game,"Looking at the other reviews, there seems to be a miscommunication about what type of film this is."
Big Game,"So this reviewer will be crystal clear: from the moment film first went into the camera, this project was intended a family/kids film destined to appear on cable channels all over the world either on a Saturday matinée or in the after-dinner hours."
Big Game,"Aside from Sam Jackson (whom I have been calling in my reviews since the 1990s ""the most overexposed actor in film history"") everyone else is second tier B movie material."
Big Game,"This is not die-hard ""puberty edition."" This is about fathers and sons and everything else is secondary to that."
Big Game,"So, now that we are crystal, it is really not bad. The effects are good, the bad guys are convincing, and even the action scenes work well."
Big Game,Above average kids flick.
Big Game,"I saw this movie with my wife, she was jiggling all the time,i had 2 dusins of good laughs, even though there are so many actual fact flaws on geography and politics. the plot is fine and the acting ok but most of all its damned good fun and impecable special effects and explotions,so dont hesitate watching this,its childish but great entertainment even for an old grumpy guy as me."
Big Game,"Adding to the series of recent movies involving President of The United States being in peril, Big Game is also presenting a quirky and amusing angle on the premise. Having more action than expected and lightly humorous, it hits on the right spot with just the right amount of casual fun. Some of the scenes are ridiculous, though the strange duo and witty material will be an accessible delight for audience."
Big Game,"Story follows The President of Unites States (Samuel L. Jackson) and an ordinary Finnish boy Oskari (Onni Tommila) who is undergoing traditional coming of age ritual. Oskari must prove himself by hunting a game from the forest, but a strange encounter with The President will distract him from his goal. This may be the weirdest duo of buddy action flick, but at this point Samuel L. Jackson could probably deliver any bizarre character asked of him."
Big Game,"The President is not the usual action character, in fact compared to the pursuers he is largely outclassed. It's a playful personality with more emphasis on comedy than his usual brash attitude, although the film doesn't deprive audience from his trademark mockery. Oskari is also far from a secret service agent, he's just a young boy and eager to prove himself."
Big Game,"The large difference on both characters play to their advantage in creating a few chuckles. Some other notable names for the supporting cast such as Victor Garber and Ray Stevenson also are appreciated. Casting isn't far from their usual roles, and they adequately presentable here."
Big Game,"Script is pretty good, the jokes are spot-on without being overly crude. The film has light-hearted vibe, engaging on simple theme fitting for a family movie. Visual is unexpectedly vibrant. There are several moments worthy of any action movies. These few high octane shots balance the silly antics. Its foreign setting creates a more refreshing outlook than the usual city environment of the genre, it's definitely a better view than being confined in White House again."
Big Game,"Visually fresh and charmingly witty, Big Game is a simple yet entertaining action comedy."
Big Game,So Samuel L. Jackson is the President of the United States and is shot down in Finland where the men and real men and the 13 year old boys are out in the wilderness trying to prove that they are real men.
Big Game,"The President of the US of A is just a foil for this Finnish story about Oskari who, on turning 13 must go out into the wilderness to bring back some game. His grandfather killed a bear at the same age, but maybe Oskari is not up to the task?"
Big Game,But then the President of the US of A turns up while being hunted by terrorists and Oskari is there to prove that being strong is not about muscles but about willpower.
Big Game,"So finally we get a story where the US is not all powerful, but seriously doesn't Finland have an air force that could scrambled to search the area? When the US armed services get permission to operate on Finish territory and why wasn't any killed by being hit by a Nokia?"
Big Game,"So the verdict. Every stupid moment in this film is brilliant, and most brilliant moments are also at least a little stupid. It works and is worth watching."
Big Game,What the movie is about is that if you go into the forest it will give you a gift that is meant to both test and reward you.
Big Game,"An absurd story about a thirteen year old saving the President of United States. Checked. Unbelievable action sequences featuring exploding aircrafts and bulletproof protagonists. Checked. One- dimensional villains who have no shame uttering cheesy dialogue. Checked. Throw Samuel L. Jackson into the mix and congratulations, you have Big Game."
Big Game,"Set in Finland, Big Game begins by introducing the audience to young Oskari (Onni Tommila) and the traditions of his small community. Just a day shy of his thirteenth birthday, Oskari embarks on a coming-of- age tradition that requires him to survive and hunt alone in the frigid wilderness of the Finnish Lapland. The son of a hunter who brought back a bear in the same hunting tradition, Oskari has big shoes to fill in order to prove his worth."
Big Game,"Meanwhile, up in the skies, the aircraft carrying U.S President Moore (Samuel L. Jackson) is coming under missile attacks. Forced into an emergency evacuation pod by trusted Secret Service Agent Morris (Ray Stevenson), Moore finds himself hurtling down into the foreign landscapes of the Finnish wilderness. Fortunately for Moore, his pod is discovered by Oskari, who happens to conveniently be within the vicinity of his landing. Unknown to Moore however, is that Morris has gone rogue and is conspiring with Hazar (Mehmet Kurtulus), a psychotic terrorist bent on hunting Moore as game."
Big Game,"There is a difference between films that parody or pay homage to movie genres and films that masquerade itself as one. While one speaks volume of a director's understanding of the genre, the other says much about the director's skills (or lack thereof). Unfortunately for director Jalmari Helander, Big Game belongs to the latter category."
Big Game,"Despite Helander's inclusion of clichés and tropes, Big Game just does not come across as a throwback, parody or homage to the action genre. In fact, Big Game starts off well as an action flick with its premise and characters. As such, oddities in the film can be easily seen as awkward set-ups as long as they fulfill their purposes later in the story. The strange emergency evacuation pod on board the aircraft, for example, can be forgiven as it plays a role in creating the interesting encounter between the President and Oskari."
Big Game,"What is unforgivable, however, is when oddities in plot and logic overpower the main focus of the film. Instead of focusing on Oskari's development and personal growth, Helander decides to, as put across by Kirk Lazarus, ""go full retard"" and spends his budget on ridiculously exaggerated action sequences. The tonal shift, beginning with Oskari's decision to jump onto a freezer transported by a helicopter, is the ""jumping the shark"" moment that marks the descend of the film into a ludicrous b-grade movie; so much so that Jackson and Tommila's performances are lost in face of the bizarre comic book violence."
Big Game,"Plot loopholes are also abundant in the film, making the viewing of the film a strange experience. For instance, CIA terrorist expert Hurbert's (Jim Broadbent) involvement in the President's assisnation is not clearly explained; the same with his relationship with Hazar. Felicity Huffman's lack of lines as the bland CIA Director also suggests that the film has been edited and re-edited into a pale translation of the original script."
Big Game,"That being said, Big Game can be enjoyable if you are a connoisseur of B-grade action flicks. With it campy plot and exaggerated action sequences, Big Game is one action-adventure flick that B-grade movie lovers should not miss."
Big Game,"ridiculous movie about the President of the United States ever made. Sam L. Jackson plays the POTUS; however instead of Mr. toughguy, he's a wimp. The wimpiest President ever. He's so wimpy, even his lead secret service agent can't stand him and was willing to sell out to get rid of President."
Big Game,"So the president is flying to Finland and his plane is shot down. It just so happens, that a 13 year old boy has set out on a quest to prove he's a man and comes upon the president in the woods. Eventually, the bad guys find them, even get the president. Then one of the most crazy, stupid scenes ever in which the helicopter lowers the freezer below tree level to try to knock off the kid. And they aren't worried about the helicopter being pulled down, or perhaps the president jumping out when the freezer is only a foot of the ground."
Big Game,"Soon the 2 free the freezer and go tumbling down a hill and into a lake, yet don't have any broken bones. They find the plane below water and decide to swim inside it because of course they know the plane still has plenty of air pockets inside. Then there's the crazy ending with the ejecting seats and somehow they aren't burned alive when the plane blows up right below them."
Big Game,"FINAL VERDICT: This is one of those movies that it is so crazy, it's funny. But Sam L. Jackson has played much better characters, he's supposed to be the bad@ss, not the wimp. Watch at your own risk, you may loose a few brain cells."
Big Game,"I was dragged to this Movie today by my Son. He Dragged me to See Age Of Ultron Last week and even though I'm a fan of Marvel, I thought there was far too much going on in that Movie."
Big Game,"But back to this one. Do you remember the old Bruce, Arnie and Stallone Movies before they got old. This is just like those movies. We get Action, Characters to Care about Action. Funny One liners. Action. And we feel good at the end. Did I mention Action."
Big Game,"Nobody is going to win and Oscar here but if you like bringing your kids to the movies, this is for you."
Big Game,Great Fun. Just what Movies used to be like.
Big Game,"Samuel L Jackson is the disgruntled President of the United States who is the target of an attack that leaves him crash landed in the forest of Finland aided only by Oskari, a Finish boy trying to prove himself as a hunter and as a man. WHAT MORE CAN YOU WANT?!"
Big Game,"This is the best camp action movie I have seen in a long time (and I'm counting The Expendables). It's so much fun to watch. Onni Tommila as Oskari is so brilliant and hilarious, and stands up no problem to Sam Jackson."
Big Game,Definitely what you're looking for on a Friday night in with a buddy and a beer.
Big Game,"Big Game is mainly about the US President, played by Samuel L. Jackson, rescued by a young boy who is on a hunting mission, which lead the two into an unlikely bond and soon face a band of terrorists. That strange yet magnificent idea easily sums up what you're going to get in this movie. In concept, this is supposed to be Finland's take on the old school Hollywood action movies. It sets in a life of local deer hunters around a preposterous action movie plot and the movie just embraces the silliness, and without any pretension, this results to one of the most delightful experiences one would get in a dumb action movie in a while. And even for a B-movie (if that's what they claim), there is so much impressive achievements to look around, which sometimes the film felt a little too smug about it. But this film offers more excitement than what this rather simple plot suggests."
Big Game,"And just like what the classics do, it begins with tons of exposition, to fully establish the characters and the plot. But instead of being about some regular guy who gets mixed up with a tough situation, we get a kid who already seem competent to the job, but haven't fully earned his skill and experience, yet. It takes long enough to get to the real action, but the real shining moments here are whenever the two misfits interact, trying to bear with each other and contradict with the ridiculous choices one of them makes for survival, in a naturally comedic sense. While the threat still involves some risks and violence, this journey is all lighthearted. The heroes are basically just running around, choosing some crazy ways to escape from the bad guys as adventurous as possible. There's another side to this which takes place in Pentagon where the government officials are searching for the President. These scenes don't offer beyond than serving exposition and reveal needless twists, but isn't as exciting as the actual adventure."
Big Game,"People may still clamor this as a B-movie, but even for that impression, every visual and scale actually look more impressive than most Hollywood blockbusters today tend to offer. It looks heavily CGI-ed and people usually point out the flaws of the aesthetics, but here it's just beautifully bright and shiny that it never really matter if it's real or not. It simply polishes the supposedly dumb as schlock action, which might have lead the direction to somewhat slow the pace for style and swagger that sometimes becomes dragging, but the images brought a huge benefit, anyway. The performances are just delightful. No one might have done it better as this President than Samuel L. Jackson. It may sound like a punchline at first, but then he eventually manages to give something engaging to this character, and of course, Jackson does what he does best. But the actor who really steals the show here is Onni Tommila, who happens to be the the real action hero among the duo. Aside of excitingly pulling off warrior-like instincts, he also manages to get invested to the character's arc and comedic moments. The ones who play the villains stay campy as they should, and there is a surprising amount of other great actors here who aren't nearly as memorable as its stars, but they did their job solidly, anyway."
Big Game,"Big Game is a lot of fun, with a variety of amusingly odd ideas that come off great for a mindless action experience. But the best parts are really when the two heroes are together, trying to fit in from their unlikeness. I guess the only major thing to complain now is there should be more. It's not like that is going to make this a masterpiece, but it does left you wanting more, like we want to see more of these characters and explore more absurdity that this journey can come with. I mean, there's a scene where a fridge, where our heroes are hiding, is rolling down into the waterfall, with Samuel L. Jackson's character paranoia adding up the pricelessness of the scene. And that's just one example of what makes this movie delightfully adventurous."
Big Game,"""Not political, not religious. He is just a certified grade-A psychopath."""
Big Game,"I thought ""Why the hell not ?"" after seeing the poster of ""Big Game"". An adventure film, clearly aimed at a younger audience, with Air Force One crashing down somewhere in a Finnish forest and with the US president trying to saving himself with the help of a Finnish boy who just happens to undergo a local ritual so he can prove himself to the male population. And after I saw that Samuel L. Jackson also took part in this movie as the missing president, I didn't hesitate for a second. It's true that Jackson played some minor roles before this (""Oldboy"", ""Reasonable Doubt"" and ""Robocop""), yet I was pleasantly surprised by his last performance in ""Kingsman: The secret service"". So I went on the assumption that this was going to be a likable youth film, full of unabashed and not too far-fetched action."
Big Game,"Boy oh boy. I didn't expect this to be such a crappy movie full of improbabilities, ridiculous situations and coincidences. Admittedly, it's indeed aiming for a younger audience, filled with teenage boys, who can have nice dreams that same night after watching such a film and imagine themselves acting as such a hero. But I'm convinced that most of them will shake their heads out of disapproval, while wondering if the makers of this film actually were convinced that they are really so naive."
Big Game,"First lets start with the positive aspects. The scenery is matchless and breathtaking beautiful. I had no idea that Finland looked like that and I was tempted immediately to choose this country as a destination for my next holiday. Onni Tommila, a youthful Finnish actor, performed properly and does his job as the Finnish guide Oskari remarkably well. The entire film is clearly a homage to earlier films with youthful heroism as a central theme. It's a kind of film like ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" in which Short Round plays a prominent role or a typical Spielberg film like ""Empire of the Sun"". It brings back the nostalgia of fathers going to the cinema with their son to enjoy a cool film for guys. A prerequisite for such films is that the youthful contribution should smoothly transcend the ingenuity of the adults. In other words, the adults are presented as utter fools."
Big Game,"What bothered me the most about this movie, were the totally absurd situations that arose. I admit, when you look at it from the perspective of a young person and you don't take it too serious, it comes across as an entertaining movie. A sort of ""Home Alone"" in a forest, where you're always a bit smarter and faster than the bad guys. But there are limits. Firstly I would like to purchase the brand of freezer they used here, because I think this high-tech-wonder-equipment is indestructible. Swinging under a helicopter, mowing through the woods, tumbling from a mountain, splashing into a lake and afterwards popping up out of the water like a purebred Russian submarine. And this ""undamaged"" ! Now that's what I call solid quality. But beware ! Make sure you don't end up inside this miracle appliance, because apparently it can't be opened from the inside. The number of accidental meetings is huge. Coincidentally, the probe with the POTUS is landing where Oskari made his camp. The freezer pops out of the water where Air Force One incidentally crashed. And you just need to follow a suspicious helicopter on satellite, and you end up looking at POTUS. The criminal Hazar (Mehmet Kurtulus) apparently isn't such a hot-shot criminal afterall, because he doesn't even know how to load an automatic rifle. And the way the satellite images are used in the Pentagon to follow the president, is just hilarious."
Big Game,"I admit, It shouldn't always be that serious and occasionally a lightly youth film is also welcome, but there are limits to follies and ridiculous situations. As a boy I'd fall for this blindly. But as an adult, who started watching this film unprepared, it gradually began to annoy me more and more because of the series of stupidities. The final image full of patriotism and heroism ultimately, was a bit too much for me."
Big Game,"You gotta cock it, Motherf . Oops."
Big Game,More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT
Big Game,"I can't understand all the haters out there hating on this one. It brings the cinema back to life the way other gratuitous movies like Armageddon, Goonies and The Rock did. It's a mix of Spielberg and Roland Emmerich. It's big, it's fun, adventurous and endearing, total adventure escapism, the way good movies should be. The cinematography is beyond astounding, and 1/2 the acting is really good. But, 1/2 the acting is really, really bad unfortunately, especially Samuel Jackson and his entourage. I kind of feel bad for Samuel Jackson in a way. It's only been recently that I haven't wished for or expected him to say some pulp fiction gangster lines in every scene. Somehow he looks depressed in this movie. Maybe because he can't say some bad-ass gangster lines? I would kill to see a pulp fiction spin off of his character, maybe roaming the world like Cain from Kung-Fu and, like the A-Team, doing good things and saving people. Or, glorious abandon, his pulp fiction character meeting up with the A-Team? Only in my dreams."
Big Game,"""Big Game"" is a film from last year written and directed by Jalmari Helander. If you heard of him, this is probably mostly due to his several ""Rare Exports"" (short) movies. He is from Finland and this also shows in his work here. Not only is the boy a Finnish actor that Helander worked with in the past, but there is Finnish dialog included and almost the entire film is set in Finland. However, there are also American influences. Or I should maybe say English-speaking influences instead as many of the actors are not from the United States."
Big Game,"I myself was delighted to see Ted Levine in here as well as Jim Broadbent and of course Samuel L. Jackson playing the President of the United States. My title of this review may initially refer to the young boy, but, as the movie goes on, it also applies to the President, who really starts off as a useless weakling. This was also a nice parody on the likes of Presidents turning into almost superheroes in other films when in dangerous situations. He does not and relies on a little Finnish boy to save his ass repeatedly. Special shoutout to Mehmet Kurtulus. I am from Germany and was pretty surprised to see him in here. Positive surprise for sure, he can pull off villain roles nicely. Yes the film is unrealistic many times, but it's lots of fun as well, so you can deal with the likes of the boy shooting one of the bad guys from a great distance with a self-made bow and arrow."
Big Game,"Helander kept this film pretty essential, movie does not even reach the 80-minute mark without credits. But he did a fine job I must say. You cannot even call the film too predictable. Yes it became obvious that the Vice President was in it at some point, but I did not expect Broadbent's character to be a part of it as well. Actually, this is another aspect where this film parodies other films and funnily goes even more over-the-top with the VP's last scene in the bathroom. This certainly made me curious about Helander's work. I recommend it. Don't watch it when you want something deep, but this is great pointless fun. Thumbs up."
Big Game,"Watching this you do know where it's heading (cliches and all), but it's still a fun experience if you let it be and roll with it. It might be a bit difficult for some to read subtitles from time to time, but Samuell L. Jackson as POTUS is just incredible and as funny as that sounds it can be."
Big Game,"The kid actor is really good too and the direction of the movie is entertaining as that ""christmas"" movie was the director did prior to that. But you can't compare this too much with Rare Exports, this being more of a Hollywood affair and therefor not having as many edges as that other movie. Good little entertainment, not much more, but not that much less"
Big Game,"Samuel L. Jackson plays the POTUS. He is considered a feckless leader in the war on terror and as such, those who oppose the terrorists have planned to kill him. His plane is shot down over the mountains of Finland. At the same time Oskari (Onni Tommila) turned 13 and is going to become a man by hunting big game. He is alone in the woods with a bow and and about four arrows. He barely has the strength to pull back the bow. He rescues the POTUS from his escape pod and the two of them are on the run for their lives."
Big Game,"The film was okay. I was hoping the kid would do some Rambo/Home Alone type stuff, i.e. set traps etc. but it didn't happen. The film is basically kid safe. At one point Samuel L. Jackson says ""Mother F"" and stops short of completing the phrase."
Big Game,"I can't remember when I last saw a movie that was THIS mind-numbingly stupid. Compared to this, the Avengers or Snakes on a Plane are factual documentaries!"
Big Game,"There is ONE highlight in this movie, the kid actor Onni Tommila. And he is the only reason I found it mildly entertaining, even though he could not save the movie."
Big Game,"Samuel Jackson (does he actually take ANY role that is pitched to him?) is far from his best and his character behaves highly inconsistent. Everything else is so constructed and unbelievable, sometimes it physically hurts!"
Big Game,"The sad thing is, with a little more care, better writing and directing, this could have been a quite decent movie.The basic story has potential, but is utterly ruined by constant bull-crap that keeps you face-palming over and over."
Big Game,"One star because I can't give zero, and one for the kid."
Big Game,"If you liked ""Air Force One"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" you'll like ""Big Game"" because it starts off as the former and morphs into the latter."
Big Game,"Generic bad guys are hunting Jackson, who is President of the United States, and a fourteen-year-old Finnish boy through the dank and chilly forests and over the gray rocks of Never Never Land."
Big Game,"It's not worth much attention. Jackson and the little boy, Onni Tommila, survive impossible jolts -- in slow motion -- and perform impossible feats, while making wisecracks. It's an extravaganza of computer-generated images."
Big Game,"A few points worth noting. One is that Jackson, unlike Harrison Ford, is not a president who has won the Congressional Medal of Honor and has a black belt in sashimi or something. He's an ordinary suit who can get clobbered by one of the heavies."
Big Game,Two is that the little boy is pretty ugly in an exotic way and a sullen bastard. There's nothing cute about him. He's not a bad actor either although little is demanded of him.
Big Game,"Three is that it's always interesting to see who the bad guys are and discover their motives. This film is a little disappointing in that regard. That most of the bad guys LOOK like bad guys and one is ""the son of one of the most powerful Sheiks"" is to be expected these days. He's described as not religious, not ideological, just ""a Grade-A psychopath."" (Yet he IS an Arab.) But the leader of the band is an ordinary European-looking chap who is bitter and resolute beyond belief but who is given no motive at all except for a dislike of the president. This guy takes his exit via magic bullet ex machina."
Big Game,"The kids may enjoy the slam-bang action. And the unfolding of the clichés may be soothing for adults, the way all rituals are soothing."
Big Game,"Big Game isn't even at least as good and original movie than Helanders previous movie Rare Export was. Big Game is actually B-class action movie with quite bad script. As a action movie Big Game is very mediocre action movie, but with it's boyish charm it is great tribute for those great action movies from eighties. Big Game has fine boyish charm, which remind me my childhood Steven Spielberg movies. With this charm combined with reality that this is the most expensive Finnish movie so far and verity for that Jalmari Helander is self learned movie maker without any movie studies you can't just pass this movie and see it as a mediocre action rumble. In reality movie has many flaws an quite bad script, but despite that it is at the same time quite enjoyable movie. Movie shooting is beautiful and descending of Air Force One is first class and well done CGI-effect. In some scenes you can unfortunately sense acting in front of green screen, but even with it flaws movie is quite enjoyable to watch. Big Game could be little longer movie. Now with too long epilogue movies action with Onni Tommila and Samuel L. Jackson feels a little too short. Few extra scenes would make it better, because now it feel to end too soon. Movie script is quite mediocre and coarse and not so original like Rare Export was. With all it austerities it is still enjoyable boyish action movie with quite less violence. Hopefully Jalmari Helander has guts to say yes to Hollywood near future. I would love to see another great director in the helm of big budget Hollywood production near future."
Big Game,"OMG. Terrible script, ridiculous plot, technically awful, appalling acting, some of the most awkward lines in the history of movies."
Big Game,Give this a wide berth!
Big Game,"Just saw Final girl (avoid it), Barely Lethal (avoid it too) and some other movies with tough kids. It might be (again) a trend in ""Hollywood""."
Big Game,Anyway this is a movie that actually delivers in terms of action and the satisfaction of the audience.
Big Game,"A 13 y.o. boy follows the tradition of his village in northern Finland and as apart of an initiation he must camp in the woods and bring a big game (like a deer) back to his father who is a great hunter. The movie takes a big turn when it is revealed that Air Force One with POTUS in it, is about to crash at the same woods as part of a conspiracy or terrorist act! The young actor Onni Tommila is suitable for the part and manages to deliver a solid performance. The rest of the cast is good too."
Big Game,You do have some Hollywood type of action (in terms of visuals and unbelievable situations) and you get to see some wild northern forests which make the movie bearable to watch.
Big Game,Overall: Check it out. It's not great but it delivers some satisfaction to the audience.
Big Game,"Comic book violence with gleaming visuals apart, this Finnish action-adventure has doses of ridiculousness scattered all over the place."
Big Game,"A young lad (Tommila) from a pre-modern Finnish hunting community bumping into POTUS (Jaskson) who has just been betrayed by his security chief, and rescuing him from the clutches of those who seek him is not called coincidence, but a result of a brainstorm conducted by few half developed brains that were enticed with the prize of big money."
Big Game,"The plot is hardly convincing, let alone logical. Of course, we have seen Hollywood biggies like Olympus Has Fallen (2013) and White House Down (2013) that deal with the same theme in the past, this one is not even near to what filth they had to offer. The dumbness is introduced in the first few minutes and after that, refuses to clear out from the screenplay that is sampled with traces of embarrassing humor. That there is a cue for essential time managers to leave the seat and go home, never to return."
Big Game,"Big Game has some delicious visuals that will excite your senses, if you can ignore the mindlessness, that is. There is some Greek thrown into your face by the archer protagonist, which somehow didn't have proper subtitles at my county screening. Terrible stunts and even terrible dialogs is what makes the film viewing unpleasant. And there is one hell of a robust refrigerator they have there. If I could gift that to my girlfriend, oh well, I'd be lucky every night for the rest of my life."
Big Game,BOTTOM LINE: Big Game is a film whose weak writing is only exceeded by its weak writing.
Big Game,Rating: 3 stars out of 10 - below average.
Big Game,Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES
Big Game,"It starts out well enough. At about the 50 minute mark, this movie goes full retard. Never go full retard. This may be the worst Samuel L. Jackson movie ever. The kid is not a good actor. This movie feels like a Chuck Norris movie from the 80's, except it's not even good to laugh at. To whomever made this movie: It must be nice to have 8.5 million dollars to just flush down the toilet. Do yourself a favor, just flush the money you were going to spend to watch this movie down the toilet. At least you will save the 1.5 hours. I figured I would waste another 5 minutes writing this review, in hopes that I can spare some unsuspecting people out there from the same pitfall. Please, give my respects to the outside world. I fear that I may never come back to reality, after this poop tainted spike pierced my brain."
Big Game,"When Air Force One is blown out of the sky over Finland, POTUS Sam L Jackson's escape pod (!) puts him under the care of 13-year old Oskari who is undergoing a hunting right of passage in the mountains and forests with a bow and arrow. When the terrorists and traitors come in pursuit, Oskari must exercise all the ingenuity at his command."
Big Game,"Let me say at the outset that this action adventure is big daft fun and, if approached on that basis, there is much to enjoy. Here are some other things to look for:"
Big Game,Jackson playing against type (up to a point – he does become the mothereffin President of the United mothereffin States before the film finishes);
Big Game,The remarkably intact bodies which have fallen from the sky;
Big Game,Likable newcomer Onni Tommila doing far more slo-mo posing than archery;
Big Game,The most improbable escape in a fridge/freezer since Indiana Jones 4;
Big Game,The fabled Finnish mountains;
Big Game,The amazing materialising/dematerialising arrows in Oskari's quiver;
Big Game,The unresolved plot twist at the end leading to a sequel which we will probably never see;
Big Game,The highly trained terrorist who doesn't know how to fire a machine gun;
Big Game,The lad who has two random archery modes: feeble and outstanding.
Big Game,"Like I said, it's big daft fun, with the emphasis on the daft."
Big Game,"First, let's admit it that this is an adventure movie for boys - and their fathers as well. A story, a fairy tale, with all possible clichés of the genre. This has been covered by other reviewers, no need to add anything."
Big Game,"However, I must thank all the actors. This was a B-class movie with a Z-class budget - with naive and primitive screen writing. Still the actors managed to honor their profession and do a very good job. I have seen many ""better"" movies with much worse acting. The hero, the Finnish boy, was of course sympathetic as child actors often are. But the biggest thanks goes to Samuel L. Jackson, he really saved the day. Not a blockbuster role, not an Oscar winning role, but absolutely professional performance with deliberate low-key twist. (As long as we forget those awful last lines he had to act-out). To me, this is a Samuel L. Jackson movie."
The Gambler,"The Gambler is a decent movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a great cast. Mark Wahlberg makes some very interesting acting choices in this movie, losing weight for the part and portraying the character in a way that really stretches beyond his usual style. I also loved the chemistry between him and Brie Larson, it was definitely the strongest aspect of the film, in my opinion, as it was pure and felt very real."
The Gambler,"The structure to this film is a bit of a mess, we are given a bunch of plot points and different reasons for this character to be in dept. It was clearly trying to overwhelm us with this characters situation, however, it just took me out of it when they began to throw too many things at me at once."
The Gambler,"As well as that, we are never given a real reason to like the character of Jim Bennett, he is irresponsible and everything that happens to him is entirely his fault. He may have redeemable qualities, but not enough for me to support him. He does pull through towards the last ten minutes of the movie, but that does not make up for ninety minutes of him being an arrogant, self centred individual."
The Gambler,"It has it moments, but there are a lot of movies similar to this that are much better. Good performances, but lacking in originality, The Gambler shines on few occasions, and I would not recommend it."
The Gambler,An obsessive gambler must get his life together to pay off his debts and be with the one he loves.
The Gambler,Best Performance: Mark Wahlberg
The Gambler,"""Eventually a debt gets too big to pay."" Jim Bennett (Wahlberg) is an English professor at a major college, as well as being a high stakes gambler. He isn't very good at either. When he falls into an insurmountable debt to a ruthless loan shark one life begins to bleed into the other and his life, and the lives of those around him, is in danger. Going in I thought this movie could go 1 of 2 ways. It could either be tense and good, or slow and boring. After watching it I would have to say it is more tense and good, but also nothing amazing. I did like this quite a bit and recommend this, but it just seems like they could have done so much more with this character. Another down side of this movie is that it is pretty much like every other movie about gambling. The best part of this movie is John Goodman, but he is so under used that it is a little upsetting. If he was in it more the movie would have been better. Overall, a movie that I did ultimately like and recommend but it is a little generic and lacking the punch it was going for. I give it a B."
The Gambler,"If there is one thing to be said about The Gambler, it is this: its poster is about as indicative as can be. For those who have yet to see the film, gear up for plenty of close-ups of a sullen, recalcitrant Mark Wahlberg fuming silently at the camera, caught somewhere between wordless scream for help and smirk of feigned badassery. Whether or not you have the stomach for two hours of much of the same is a matter of personal preference, but The Gambler, while a necessarily corkscrew of repetitive dour scenarios, explores the nature of emptiness in life, it is far from empty itself."
The Gambler,"The film, in short, is not an easy watch. Wahlberg's Jim Bennett – a moderately affluent and successful university English professor and novelist – such a startlingly persistent downward spiral (he gambles, loses, racks up debt, borrows money from skeazy loan sharks, alienates the few other human beings willing to indulge him with their time, rinse and repeat) that it would seem a cautionary tale about gambling addiction, were it not clear that his true addiction is to maudlin self-punishment rather than the thrill of beating the odds. Almost more unsettling than the black hole of negativity he conjures is his lack of precisely articulated motivation behind it – is this a mere case of 'poor little privileged rich boy' listlessness, or a deeper, existential lust for purpose in life (need I mention the film is a loose adaptation of the novel of the same title by Dostoyevsky)?"
The Gambler,"It's enough to leave many prospective viewers wondering: what is the point? Why spend two hours with a fairly unlikeable character doing unlikeable things for little to no discernible purpose? A fair question. The answer is to not simply consume the film as a hip urban crime parable, despite the distinctly Michael Mann-esq aesthetic of murky ochre city lights at night director Rupert Wyatt concocts. Bennett is not meant to play is hip or cool, despite his half-hearted pretenses at such, skulking through shady ""gambling establishments"", eloquently insulting mob bouncers, sunglasses in tow, or lying on a desk, postulating on the frivolity at any attempts at artistry without a genius level of natural talent during his English 101 lectures. The key to character and film alike is to catch the glimmers of doubt twinkling behind the armour of nihilism – this is not a man who truly cares about nothing, but desperately needs to believe he does. If James Caan's take on the character in the 1974 referent film of the same name was an exploration of unfounded libido, gambling with an almost carnal lust, Wahlberg's is a study of impotence, and the façade of 'I don't care about anything' that creeps up to hide it. 'Bad boy,' 'hipster,' 'tragic antihero,' selfish swipes at James Dean-era cool – call it what you will, the film cautions, but be aware of how devastating the consequences can be to those trapped in such worldviews, as well as those audacious enough to care about them, here represented by Jessica Lange's bitterly devoted mother, and Brie Larson's enigmatically curious star student (both strong dramatic support here)."
The Gambler,"Indeed, all the cast have tremendous fun spitting out William Monahan (of The Departed fame)'s acerbic script, especially the scene-stealing double-act of loan sharks, Michael Kenneth Williams and the infallibly charismatic John Goodman (now with added baldness and shirtlessness for your viewing pleasure!). Nonetheless, bypassed by the awards circuit as he was, the film is anchored by Wahlberg's deceptively nuanced and magnetic performance. Like Goodman and Williams, we never like Bennett, and really have no reason to keep supporting him, but we are consistently captivated by a bemused, almost perverse curiosity to see just how low he will drag himself. Wahlberg, to his credit, letting only fleeting trickles of a internal geyser of emotions past his mask of flatness, makes the ride a worthwhile one."
The Gambler,"By the end, we finally get the sense that the whole ordeal, rather than addictive behaviour, was a bizarre social experiment in re-igniting lust for life – enough so that even the ambiguously upbeat ending rings strangely true in spite of its seeming artifice. The biggest gamble of all, as an audience member, is allowing yourself to see the film through, smirks and sunglasses and all. You just might not be sorry that you did."
The Gambler,-7/10
The Gambler,Yes this is a gambling film and includes just about every cliché you can think of. No it isn't any good.
The Gambler,"Yes Mark Wahlberg plays a gambler. No he doesn't hit, shoot, stab, or otherwise assault anyone."
The Gambler,"Yes the film has several excellent co-stars like George Kennedy, Andre Braugher, and Richard Schiff. No you won't see very much of them and if you sneeze you may miss them."
The Gambler,Yes there is some romance. No it doesn't work with a girl who is half Wahlberg's age.
The Gambler,Yes it's great to see John Goodman in a meaty role. No he isn't going to play Jabba the Hut in the next Star Wars release.
The Gambler,Yes I did stay for the entire movie hoping that the final scene would somehow raise the stature of the film. No it didn't.
The Gambler,"The seedy underworlds that are often associated with gambling and the mafia are worlds that loan themselves to film, for they breed certain characters, themes, and ideas that simply captivate, and provide audiences with ideas as to how a subculture operates. Having said that, it's a shame in the last few years, we've gotten a small, mediocre array of these films when the genre used to be dominated by the likes of people like Martin Scorsese, Al Pacino, and Robert De Niro, who knew how to create arresting films based off the mob. With Rupert Wyatt's The Gambler, a remake of the James Caan film of the same name coming at the end of the year following a recent trailer release like the film's release was an afterthought, we get another middling effort to showcase strong acting talent but mediocre-to-average screen writing as we watch a captivating idea be squandered by a bloated yet underdeveloped plot."
The Gambler,"Mark Wahlberg plays Jim Bennett, a literature professor and a gambling addict, who doesn't know the meaning of quitting when he is up. Bennett rolls away at his odds until he is completely out of money, losing whatever winnings he accumulated and then some. He is in debt to numerous loan sharks, one of which Neville Baraka (Michael K. Williams), who, along with a Korean loan shark, informs him he has seven days to pay back a $240,000 debt or else he is whacked. Jim looks toward Frank (John Goodman), a ruthless, but almost philosophical man, who proposes to loan him the money but fears of his ability, or lack thereof, to compensate him on his investment. Meanwhile, Jim tries to keep it together in the classroom, as he stands before a group of clearly disinterested men and women, who aren't in the classroom to learn anymore than he is in there to teach. However, he takes a liking to Amy (Brie Larson), one of his students who shows great potential in writing. When discussing the idea of following one's dreams as a writer in class, he informs the remainder of his students that, ""if you're not a genius, don't even bother."""
The Gambler,"Jim's thoughtless cynicism and complete disregard for his own life, without the merit or humor or any cogent philosophy or backstory, robs him of any ability to even be a tolerable anti-hero. He's a miserable character, with the only bonus of being played by Wahlberg, one of the finest leading actors working today, who communicates Jim's moroseness nicely throughout the film. Wahlberg is surrounded by other performers, who work equally well at matching his level of conviction, specifically Goodman, whose few scenes in the film amount to greatness in a predictable yet pleasant manner. Goodman delivers a great monologue about the luxury of having ""f*** you money,"" which he estimates to be about $2.5 million. With that net worth, you don't need to take orders from anyone, and if anyone angers you, you can give them the old seven-letter phrase with great effect."
The Gambler,"Wahlberg and Goodman are great fun to watch because they've played these kind of wayward characters in prior films, so they know the landscape and the material is fresh in their heads. However, screenwriter William Monahan (who also wrote Scorsese's Departed) threatens to lose control of the project when he writes in multiple different characters and several subplots, not developing enough to reach the level where we care about them. We already have an unlikable main character, and we can't rely on much of the cast to feed our desire to find someone we can at least sympathize with, so all we have is Jim and some bookies-turned-philosophers when the screenplay calls for it to supply character interest. Even the love story Monahan tries to concoct doesn't work, and at that point, we are essentially watching a collection of an interesting parts struggling to find something to work with while masquerading in a backdrop of strong cinematography by Greig Fraser (who also did this year's Foxcatcher, along with Zero Dark Thirty) and some well-executed musical cues that emphasize rather than embellish key moments."
The Gambler,"The Gambler, as a whole, however, doesn't work because despite the high stakes and the large risk factor, we see the carelessness and the disinterest of our main character run so freely throughout the film, that we ask ourselves why we should care that this man is seven days away from a grisly demise. We can appreciate the actors, the way the setting is presented, and the music we're provided with to a certain degree, but when it comes time to dive into these characters, their motivations, and their will to live, they have very little, so why are we watching their lazy contentment with such a dour existence?"
The Gambler,"Starring: Mark Wahlberg, John Goodman, Michael K. Williams, and Brie Larson. Directed by: Rupert Wyatt."
The Gambler,"I have read few unfavourable reviews about The Gambler mostly saying the film is not gripping enough. I disagree. At no stage did i lose interest in what was going on and i thought the tension was palpable at times. A really good leading performance from Mark Wahlberg and it's good to see Michael Kenneth Williams ( Omar Little from The Wire ) in a big role. If i had to be picky i would say that the three people who Jim owed money to could have been a little bit more menacing and the ending is a little bit confusing ( or that could just be me ! ). Overall though an entertaining , enjoyable movie which also has a great soundtrack."
The Gambler,"I read some reviews here I can see that we have mixed feelings about The Gambler. Some hate it, some love it. I thought it was an okay movie to watch once. I didn't think it was that boring like some want to make us believe. Mark Wahlberg plays a gambler that isn't very passionate about his life anymore. He just searches for somebody to live for, to give him some passion in his boring life. Due to his lack of passion for anything he creates big debts and he doesn't really care about it. Maybe the debt collectors should have been a bit more violent to make the movie more satisfying to some but to me it was okay. Michael Kenneth Williams gave us a good performance as well. John Goodman with a smaller role was also good in his typical way. I found the soundtrack of the movie really good. It just fitted really well with the story and ambiance. Unlike others I wasn't bored at all with this movie. I certainly saw worse movies then this one."
The Gambler,"Despite being tedious and annoyingly creating its own problems, The Gambler is still a really good drama that manages to come to a very satisfying conclusion. Mark Wahlberg is great. Brie Larson, John Goodman and Michael K. Williams all give really good supporting performances. Rupert Wyatt's direction is also really good. The soundtrack is excellent and the music by Theo Green and Jon Brion is good."
The Gambler,"I can't really answer that, because I haven't seen the original movie this is based on. I try to watch the original movies, before watching a remake, but I couldn't in this case. All I know is that James Caan was in the original as well as in this one (although his role in this one is pretty limited, still impactive though)."
The Gambler,"There has been a lot of criticism of Mark Wahlberg, but it's the role he's playing. I have more problems with his Transformers ""character"" than with his character in this one. The role demands him to have a certain apathy. You will either be annoyed by that or relish in that. Not to mention the supporting cast and their great roles."
The Gambler,"The movie tries the philosophical route, which again will either work for you or annoy you. It's tough to completely get into the mindset of our main character, though that is not necessarily a bad thing ..."
The Gambler,"Screenwriter and self confessed compulsive gambler James Toback joined William Monahan to concoct this rather bizarre but ultimately fascinating film about a very bright English Literature Associate Professor who is an inveterate gambler. Rupert Wyatt directs this cross between philosophy of life and the dangers of the life of gambling. Jim Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) is a risk taker. Both an English professor and a high-stakes gambler, Bennett bets it all when he borrows from a gangster (Michael Kenneth Williams) and offers his own life as collateral. Always one step ahead, Bennett pits his creditor against the operator of a gambling ring and leaves his dysfunctional relationship with his wealthy mother (Jessica Lange) in his wake. He plays both sides, immersing himself in an illicit, underground world while garnering the attention of Frank (John Goodman in a superb performance), a loan shark with a paternal interest in Bennett's future. As his relationship with a student (Brie Larson) deepens, Bennett must take the ultimate risk for a second chance."
The Gambler,"The strange admixture of classroom teaching with students whose views of learning vary from creativity to going pro-basketball (Anthony Kelley) bring out some interesting philosophical comments from Jim the teacher to the underworld of crime and gambling that is complicated by Jim's addiction to the 'sport' ultimately makes for a thought provoking film. There are some fine supporting roles by Andre Braugher, George Kennedy, Alvin Ing, Richard Schiff, but in the end the performances by John Goodman and Mark Wahlberg are the focus of the odd but compelling drama."
The Gambler,This movie is about a man who has given up hope on achieving his dreams and is trying to make his pain stop by engaging in self destructive behavior... his weapon of choice is gambling but he is not a gambler. He says so multiple times. I have read the many negative reviews of this movie and I think people are really just missing the point. He wants a real love and something real to do every day and if he achieve anything beyond mediocrity then he would rather be dead. People who can relate with that sentiment will love this movie but perhaps no one else. If you enjoy a movie that makes you think a little and go beyond what's on the surface. The movie is not about gambling... it is about finding inspiration and hope.
The Gambler,"The dark 1974 movie ""The Gambler"", starring James Caan, I thought was the definitive film about compulsive gambling. Although this modern version gives credit to James Toback (writer of the 1974 movie), I'm sorry to say I found this film to be beyond ridiculous, with incredibly stilted and pretentious dialogue, as well as absurd characters and situations."
The Gambler,"I will say the acting, given to what they have to work with, is top notch with Mark Wahlberg leading the way as Jim Bennett, an associate professor of literature at a college. He comes from an extremely wealthy family, but is a totally obnoxious, insulting jerk, who seemingly has a ""death wish"" regarding his compulsive gambling."
The Gambler,"Michael Kenneth Williams is also excellent as Neville Baraka, a loan shark and gambler, while John Goodman gives his usual most solid performance as Frank, another loan shark and mobster. Poor Brie Larson, who has to play the role of Amy Phillips here. She's one of Jim's students, and apparently a genius of a writer, but the more she sees Jim destroying himself with his gambling she cluelessly becomes even more attracted to him. Good luck with that!!"
The Gambler,"To me, this was quite the disappointment from two talented filmmakers, the director Rupert Wyatt (Rise of the Planet of the Apes, The Escapist), and the writer William Monahan (The Departed)."
The Gambler,"All in all, I'm sorry to say I found this movie to be far inferior to the 1970's classic, and a major disappointment for me."
The Gambler,"I like Walhberg as an actor, and I think he's a good actor. This role was a different step for him. I would not have imagined Mark as a one hit wonder novelist turned lit professor from a wealthy background who seems on the road to self destruction due to his gambling habit. He's pulling on his ability to drive a movie, and it works."
The Gambler,It's good that Wahlberg's performance was great (despite being very out of content form what we'd expected from him). The movie in itself was not really that good. I felt it acted too much like a sitcom with all our problems being fixed and wrapped up in a thirty minute format (or in this case two hours). Mark Wahlberg made you believe in how real this guy's problems were only for the story itself to contradict that.
The Gambler,"Mark was not alone in carrying the movie as he also had help from the always great John Goodman, who could have used a lot more time in the film, and Micheal Williams who played a great antagonist to Mark's protagonist"
The Gambler,"For the most part, the movie was humorous and charming all thinks to the acting chops of Markie Mark. I don't know if the academy will take notice, but we all should."
The Gambler,"Yesterday evening watched this movie and loved it, couldn't take my eyes off."
The Gambler,"This is not a gambling movie, this is a movie on pain. Existential pain. The character, Jim, played amazingly by Mark Wahlberg is the essence of it."
The Gambler,"Grown up in a rich family. Intelligent. Always been told he's the smartest & talented person in the room. But deep inside he feels mediocrity. Be is bored to the hilt. He doesn't f***ing care about cars, money, his looks and even women anymore."
The Gambler,"This is a movie about feeling alive, taking risks in life, because without a risk you're a mediocre bum, you are essentially dead. And this is exactly how Jim is feeling. Everything he does is to escape that, his flamboyant teaching, his gambling, his f*** you mentality."
The Gambler,"Deep inside he feels he has to put it all on the line, everything, his family, all his money, his life even. Doing this is the only thing that can essentially set him free."
The Gambler,"He's s stubborn and cocky f*** knowing that his only release is giving everything up, be humiliated, be on the ground and that's the basis of becoming a new and free man."
The Gambler,"Coming down to the existential reason for self destruction, first we need to burn everything down, before me can build a new city on top of it."
The Gambler,"This is his escape from his addiction, his ego & his depression. Life is a high stakes game."
The Gambler,"Perfectly done in a grim & tense setting. Loved it, very inspiring. Thanks for making this movie!"
The Gambler,"I found this movie to be very gripping, but like others have said it requires some connection with the main character. For me it was there and I thoroughly enjoyed it (as did my wife who insisted we watch it again a week later)."
The Gambler,"I really enjoyed the brief table dialogues, one of my favorite succinct quotes being something along the lines of:"
The Gambler,"Walhberg: (Pushes a 10k stack onto the blackjack table) Dealer: That is $10,000 dollars, are you sure... Walhberg: Are you a financial adviser or a dealer?"
The Gambler,"Walhbergs character is pretty unique, and borders on unbelievable, but it very consistent and represents very real emotions."
The Gambler,'THE GAMBLER': Four Stars (Out of Five)
The Gambler,"Remake to the 1974 high-stakes crime drama flick, of the same name, starring James Caan. This film stars Mark Wahlberg as a lit professor with a secret, obsessive, gambling addiction. It was written by William Monahan, who also co-wrote 'THE DEPARTED', and directed by Rupert Wyatt, who also helmed 'RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES' (which is funny given the fact that Wahlberg also starred in Tim Burton's 2001 'PLANET OF THE APES' remake). The movie costars Brie Larson, John Goodman, Michael K. Williams and Jessica Lange. None of the characters are very likable (especially it's lead) but the film is beautifully shot and full of clever, witty dialogue."
The Gambler,"Wahlberg plays Jim Bennett; a literature professor with a second (hidden) life as a high-stakes gambler. He's recently gotten himself into some serious trouble with local gangsters, due to his gambling addiction and excessive accrued debt. While trying to pay back the dangerous criminals, he also tries out an intriguing relationship with one of his students (Larson). No matter how much danger he keeps putting himself into, and loved ones, he still can never stop gambling."
The Gambler,"The film is a lot like a serious drama flick about a self destructive alcoholic, or anyone with a dangerous addiction. It's extremely depressing, and frustrating, in how Wahlberg's Bennett character can't stop gambling; no matter how much damage it does to him or anyone close to him. For that reason I could never truly like Bennett but I did continue to root for him (of course). Although most of the characters in the movie are all pretty morally depraved, it is still a fast paced and impressively suspenseful film. Wahlberg is great in it, Larson is beautiful and stunning to watch, the dialogue is always fun, and interesting, and the visuals are consistently beautiful to look at (as well). It's almost always entertaining but definitely not a feel- good movie."
The Gambler,Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/zsvb7ypwxL4
The Gambler,"If ever there was an anti gambling film, this is it. This film just shows what an addiction, gambling is, and what d..kheads they are. Why do people do it? For this gambler, Jim Bennett (Wahlberg in one of best ever performances) who bets big, and loses big (just see how big). The question here, posed in the movie, is why, the answer is for us audience to figure. I didn't know until later, that this was a remake. I never saw the original, but I was a bit p..sed to learn that, as Hollywood is now taking this just too far, with remakes, as though the think tank is losing it's volume. Jim is also a college professor, and of course, he falls in love with one of the students, a prized and pretty student (Brie Larson) who I must say looked hot at the start, who is seen working at this underground casino on the outskirts of the L.A freeway. The opening scene with the great George Kennedy on his death bed, with Wahlberg, says everything about son and grandfather relationship, but it would of been better with Kennedy playing the father. The movie doesn't wasn't you to know much about the characters, the mains are here and there, so we're more focused on Wahlberg. We feel Wahlberg's pain, but also feel anger at the character he is, and the suicidal path he's taking. Gambling is a terrible disease, and I urge people with this kind of addiction to see this, where it's ending there's beautiful light at the end of tunnel, played against a wonderful soundtrack. Other great performances are from a much more flabby Goodman (keep your shirt on please) as a loan shark, you don't wanna mess with. Lange, fantastic as usual, has still got it, playing as Wahlberg's mum, while Michael Kenneth Williams added some nice menace as a collector, with heart and a conscience, where you don't see many of these characters come with these. You can't overlook Wahlberg's performance, of Oscar status, or definitely worth of some acting accolades. This is one performance of his you gotta see, in a movie you gotta see."
The Gambler,"The Gambler tells the story of Jim Bennett, a college professor with a dangerous and self destructive addiction to gambling at underground casinos in the underbelly of Los Angeles. His addiction soon begins to effect his professional and personal life to severe and deadly consequences. The Gambler features great performances from Mark Wahlberg and Jessica Lange along with flashy and stylish direction from Rupert Wyatt. Much like the 1974 original, The Gambler is very much so a character study. We see Wahlberg's Jim Bennett in every scene, and see him make every bet, lose every hand and blow every dollar without shying away from Wahlberg. This is a new, transformed and extremely mature performance from Mark Wahlberg. He is in top form here, delivering a career best performance along with the physicality of a twig. It is certainly a better portrayal of a teacher than what we see in 2008's horrendous misfire The Happening. When we see Wahlberg in The Gambler he loses himself in long monologues that never once will make you question his validity in this part. The supporting cast features Brie Larson, Jessica Lange and John Goodman. Each give amazing performances, especially Goodman who steals some scenes from Wahlberg with colorful monologues filled with expletives and subtext that is classic William Monohan but it does grow tiring after awhile. The screenplay written by Oscar winner William Monohan is far from a perfect script but it is very interesting and keeps your attention. It doesn't pack the punch The Departed did, but it gets the job done. Rupert Wyatt proves that not only can he do a big budget action spectacle as Rise of the Planet of the Apes but he can also deliver hard hitting drama. My only issue was that Martin Scorsese is such a huge influence here in filmmaking style that you start to wonder what it would be like if Wyatt just stuck to his own style instead of trying to capture something that is clearly above his talent because it does backfire on multiple occasions especially during its Hollywood-fueled finale. For a film as dark as The Gambler, the ending just simply doesn't fit and feels more like a studio ending rather than something that would be true to the film and true to the original vibe of it all. Overall, The Gambler is a fitting remake that fails to capture the essence of the original but displays Mark Wahlberg in a career changing performance that shouldn't be missed."
The Gambler,"""The second Good Will Hunting"", the first thought that came to my mind. I was wondering a long time, if there is any movie that represents the problems of intellectuals in contrast with society, but in this case, with a difference of the origins, but nevertheless with the same golden ending. A cherry on the top is just good job with cameras and Mark's adaptation to the character with Method acting. I nearly wanted to become that professor with suicidal inclinations and existentialism, spreading throughout a TV screen, making me to look deeply into personal problem of ones born into golden beds."
The Gambler,"Through the movie I never fully understood the character itself, why he was just betting till he lost everything, despite his great intellect and predictability. However in the communication with his mother I saw the reflection of social problems of ones with, at first sight, no problems. The movie which gives you, or show up a new, or different perception is the one, which deserves appreciation and respectability. This movie offers it in some way, but it depends only on the observer to take the gold from it, or to settle with average silver."
The Gambler,"The Gambler (2014): Dir: Rupert Wyatt / Cast: Mark Wahlberg, John Goodman, Brie Larson, Michael K. Williams, Jessica Lange: Film about the dangerous lifestyle where everything is at risk. Mark Wahlberg plays literature professor Jim Bennett whose gambling addiction is so bad that he borrows from one loan shark to pay off another. He owes money and his life has a time limit if he fails to pay up. Michael K. Williams plays one of the loan sharks whom he owes a debt and he threatens to harm a female student whom Bennett is involved if he doesn't pay up. He makes a proposition that involves one of Bennett's students who could go pro in basketball. John Goodman steals moments as another loan shark who loans him money but not without a severe warning. Bennett's addiction is so horrendous that even when he is loaned money, he ends up pissing it all away gambling. This is the case with his frustrated mother, played by Jessica Lange who reluctantly takes her son to the bank where she takes out a large sum of cash. She views her relationship with her son as dead, and worse yet, he doesn't seem moved by her actions. Brie Larson plays a bright literature student who engages with Bennett until they entangle romantically. Well written despite a repetitious structure where Bennett is seen in constant inner torture but freedom can be reached, and the third act wisely wraps this up in a clever manner. Theme addresses addiction, mainly to gambling and how far one's life can spiral out of control and into the depths of despair and gambling with the lives of those around us. Score: 9 / 10"
The Gambler,"Honestly, who cares what happens to this guy? Wahlberg can do many things, but pretending to be the smartest guy in the room isn't one of them. He's more believable as a community college adjunct. And there's zero chemistry between him and Larson. Lange is the one shining star in this miasma and that's just not enough."
The Gambler,"I made it to one hour and twenty two minutes, and I just didn't care anymore."
The Gambler,Life is too short.
The Gambler,"The Gambler was a difficult film to rate. It was a movie that not everyone is going to like because not everyone is going to relate to Mark Wahlberg's character. It was a hard movie to understand. After seeing this movie you will either love it or hate it. There is really no in between. You really had to connect with the main character and his personality, and that's not possible for everyone. I really enjoyed the film because i really connected with it, but that is not going to be the case for everyone. I would highly recommend seeing it just to take the chance of loving it. Just like the gambling theme of the movie, seeing the movie will be a gamble for you."
The Gambler,"Maybe this is the best mark wahlberg movie, because he plays the smart guy who does dumber things in purpose, his gambling is more a way to try to win at everything than just gambling. Is a deeper movie when u know about gambling."
The Gambler,"Is a uplifting movie even if it gets darker at some points, and the climax is literally the most relaxing you can imagine."
The Gambler,"The Gambler is a poignant tale of a man who is in the grips of one of life's worst addictions. The Gambler is moving in several ways in that you find yourself feeling for the man's family and friends because they are dragged into his dark world as he struggles with a demon that has cost him everything. At the same time you are not only hoping that he will do the right thing and get out as he is given opportunities to do, but you are also fearing for the mans personal safety because he squanders opportunities to pay off an ever mounting debt to men that will stop at nothing to collect. Wahlberg plays the part of the gambler perfectly as do John Goodman and Michael Kenneth Williams as a couple of lone sharks who allow him to get deeper and deeper into the abyss of his addiction. The ending is comforting in knowing that he finally breaks free and will now be able to pursue a normal life with a new love that he has found. Unfortunately, counting on that one last big bet to get yourself out is seldom how it works in real life. The end is dramatic yes, but realistic no. The Gambler is a movie that is well worth watching, but it may hit home for many families who have a loved one who struggles with this terrible addiction."
The Gambler,"The Gambler is a different movie. It's not action packed or hilarious or any of that. It's more of a character study of some sorts. An english professor gets in over his head when he deals with the wrong people to support his gambling addiction. That's pretty much it. The basic storyline. Mark Wahlberg went through a fascinating transformation. His last role before this one was the muscular Cade in Transformers. In this film he's gotten so skinny you can't help but admire his dedication to his roles. This film isn't for everyone. Its not a big budgeted film. It's a small dramatic film to tell a story, not to entertain per say. John Goodman is great and very menacing. The visuals on this film are absolutely stunning. The audio is clear and my favorite scene is Mark Wahlberg running in the end to M83's 'Outro'. Mark Wahlberg explains this scene in one of the special features which for this type of film is surprising to see as many features as we receive here. If you like a good story with good performances and no explosions then this film is for you now on upgrade Upscaled 4K and Dolby Vision coming soon on paramount 4k ultra hd release November 2021"
La French,"This story, inspired by actual events that occurred in Marseilles, has already been told in the early eighties: LE JUGE, starring Jacques Perrin, as the lead character."
La French,"Well, this one is more ambitious, starring Jean Dujardin, Gilles Lelouche and Benoit Magimel as a supporting character. Those three are great figures of the new french crime movie industry. This tale takes place in Marseilles, South of France, during the mid seventies, and describes the dog fight, the terrific struggle between a hard boiled, ruthless, untouchable judge against a no less ambitious, greedy, smart and fierce drug ring leader. Jean Dujardin plays the judge and Gilles Lelouche his Némésis. The sequence between the two of them is outstanding, although it never occurred in real life. Curiously, in this movie, audiences may feel empathy for the judge but for the gangster as well. No real hero or true villain here. And I loved another gripping scene, the one with Dujardin in a phone booth, begging his wife - the beautiful Celine Salette - to come back to him. This scene was improvised by Dujardin."
La French,"This is the other half of the story of seventies classic - 'The French Connection. Jean Dujardin ('The Artist') plays Magistrate Pierre Michel who in 1974 gets promoted to deal with organised crime in Marseilles. Gilles Lellouche ('Mea Culpa' and 'Mesrine') plays the drugs uber lord 'Tany' – who rules with an iron fist and any other implement that can come to hand. He runs a crime network that includes night clubs, casinos and restaurants and will do anything to keep what he has and make tons more cash"
La French,This is one of those times when crims made so much money that they could buy their way out of trouble – even before they were in it. So inevitably Michel has more than the crooks to do battle with. It follows the story from the mid seventies and into the eighties and it is one helluva ride.
La French,"The period detail is excellent, the cars, fashions and the music are all spot one – even the decor. There is violence and plenty of potty mouth goings on, but it is all in context. It is also a stylish film that means that most shots are great to look at as well as being intensely entertaining. This is a film that should get a lot more attention and if you are a stranger to French cinema it may be a good one to start with to see just how well they can make them."
La French,"Pierre (Jean Dujardin) is a good French cop we can admire; Tany (Gilles Lellouche) is a drug lord we can like despite his murderous heroin. The Connection, loosely based on incidents surrounding the infamous French Connection, both real and depicted in William Friedkin's 1971 award-winning thriller starring Gene Hackman. If you can separate yourself from the testosterone-fueled business, you will experience a thriller of humane proportions."
La French,"Pierre has taken over the magistrate's responsibility for mob activity, and heroin is the big enemy. Writer-director Cedric Jimenez and writer Audrey Diwan expertly navigate between his daily professional activity and after-work family life with a wife and two children. When it's revealed that Pierre had an addictive gambling problem, the audience is appreciative of his weakness but cognizant of his obsessive personality, such as pursuing Tany."
La French,"The film also shows mobster Tany in his two worlds of business and family. While the director may too frequently parallel edit the two characters in these roles, he successfully reveals two characters with traits we can understand."
La French,"Beyond the inevitable blood, of which there is less than might be expected, is the oft-told tale of highly-driven men who want successful careers and happy family life—those of us who have seen many such thrillers know the balance is impossible. In a way the film draws us into each sphere with responses more sympathetic than judgmental."
La French,"The pace of The Connection is frenetic between paralleling the two principles' activities and chronicling the confrontations (I like when the two meet at a remote spot in a low-key, un-macho response for both) many of which are hair-raising heists and busts. Just as often, however, the film slows it down to a daily level that draws in our attention to the little things of life yet keeps the suspense and terror in the background."
La French,"As in A Most Violent Year, starring Oscar Isaac about a good but going-bad business man in NYC in the early '80's, so too does The Connection make that lawless time, albeit European, seductive because Dujardin is so compelling while he breaks laws to stop crime. It's ironic and complicated. That's life, and that's Chinatown, Jake."
La French,"""The Connection"" (2014 release from France and Belgium; 135 min. original title ""La French"") is an action crime drama, ""loosely based on real events"" we are reminded at the beginning of the movie. Those real events are the role the southern French city of Marseille played in supplying (some might say: overwhelming) the US with hard drugs in the 1970s. As the movie opens, it says ""Marseille, 1975"", and as we follow a motor scooter, the biker all of the sudden stops, and shoots someone in cold blood in a nearby car. We then get to know Pierre Michel, a magistrate who is just being transferred from Juvenile to Organized Crime. Michel throws himself with gusto into the mob-fighting, and along the way bruises with his colleagues at work too. At this point we're about 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out."
La French,"Couple of comments: first, when a movie puts up a disclaimer that says ""loosely based"" on real events, you can bet your last dollar that the movie departs significantly from what really happened. How is it that ""The French Connection"", surrounding similar facts from the US perspective, was made in 1971, yet this movie plays out from 1975 into the early 80s? If you set aside historical concerns, this movie does quite well, actually. The story is solid and takes its time to play out. No, there isn't a singular scene as memorable as the car/elevated train chase as in ""The French Connection"", but there is enough tension in ""The Connection"" that it kept me interested from start to finish. Second, a major plus is the historical accuracy in the decors and scenery. Right away from the opening scene on the motor scooter, I was marveling at all the 1970s French cars (Renault, Simca, Citroen, you name, they're all there, and plentiful), which I loved growing up in Belgium during that era. Likewise with attention to clothing and such. Third, the movie is technically a French-Belgian co-production, and the Belgian investors required some scenes shot in Belgium. The Krypton night club scenes were shot in Antwerp, Belgium (my original home town), and the prison scenes were shot in Charleroi, Belgium. Fourth, Jean Dujardin has a meaty character and role here, and he gives a fine performance as Magistrate Michel. Last but certainly not least, there is a very nice collection of songs in the movie from that era, both French (Serge Gainsbourg, Mike Brant, Sheila, etc.) and English (Blondie, Velvet Underground, Venus Ganga, Kim Wilde, etc.). It's available on Amazon France."
La French,"""The Connection"" opened last weekend at my local art house theater here in Cincinnati, and I finally had a chance to see it. The early evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so, and that's a shame. I found ""The Connection"" always entertaining, never boring and at times outright riveting. If you are in the mood for a quality foreign movie, or perhaps just curious how ""la French"" (as the term 'French Connection' was referred to in France) is portrayed by this French interpretation of it, you cannot go wrong with this movie. ""The Connection"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
La French,"The must use adjectives are thrilling and mind blowing. Seriously, the motion picture directed and written by Cédric Jimenez was emotionally heavy. The movie was inspired by true events set in the 1970s. It was about a Neapolitan Mafia Boss Tanny Zampa who ran a French extortion gang in Marseille, France. The Kingpin and his mob later exploded into 'The Connection'. It meant heroin purchased from Turkey being flood into New York by the French Mafia. What stood in their way was dedicated detective Pierre Michel who raged bloody war against their money laundering Empire."
La French,"In addition, this action packed Noir was set in Marseille, France. I loved how the opening scene exposed a landscape filled with historical buildings, palm trees, straight roads and the sea that reflected blue from the sky. The vibrating and aggressive sound from the motorbike gave the picture a dramatic sound. Expressive music which featured a woman singing her heart out gave a lovely mood. The song was Jerome sang by Lykke Li. Bang! Bang! Bullets flashed at a car driver on the streets. Hit men on motorbike were like characters from a western movie shooting down their victim. The act created a contrast from beautiful to horrendous."
La French,"What is more, the tense violence gave the film justice. It empathised the horrors of the French Mafia who imported tons of heroin from Turkey to France and New York City. The pace was very fast. It demonstrated how society was corrupt by dangerous mobsters who rhymed with monsters. The viciousness contained scenes of Zampa and his henchmen killing those who did not pay up protection rackets. The shootings would be extremely loud and bloody. Graphic tortures was like a rakish rhythm in the content. It showed how evil bloodbaths were. There are media reports of President Nixon declaring war against drugs. This showed what impact on drug affairs did on lives."
La French,"Moreover, Tanny Zampa was like a black and white painting. He loved his family and destroyed his enemies. He owned a fabulous club in Marseille. The dedicated detective Pierre Michel was hungry to bring an end to 'The Connection'. Pierre went to the extent in taking the law into his own hands to expose his patriotic nature. The two main contrasting characters had their glorious rise and tragic downfalls."
La French,"To add, a scene which I also liked the most was when Tanny and his thugs interrogated their extortion victim. The sufferer was strapped to a chair. He wore his fabulous tuxedo. The room had silver walls. The scene played classic disco music which empathised disturbing psychology on mobsters killing legit people who did not pay up protection rackets. A gunned down casino owner. Left to bleed in a car park in broad day light. Tanny and his boys walked off like it just was business nothing personal."
La French,"To carry on, the visualisation had some glimpse shots, fast forwarding and an expression in chiaroscuro. The film looked like a production from the 1970s. This helped empathise the time period. Laurent Tangy as the cinematographer expressed the contrast between light and shade. It resulted to the picture having a dark and light atmosphere. From urban to a reveal location, the lighting exposed the two different worlds. In Tanny's nightclub the cinematographer strengthen the shade and exaggerated the lighting. The high saturation was the icing on the cake. The camera shots in the French picture had long distance shots, up right footages and birds eye view. This implied the importance of society."
La French,"As a continuation, soundtrack included an orchestra, disco music and electronic. The sound effects in the film created a tense tone. It backed up how 'The Connection' had a negative effect on Marseille and New York. The emotionally heavy orchestra which was played in the end implied the tragic downfalls of the two opposing characters. Detective Pierre was shot and left to death in his neighbourhood. Crime Boss Tanny was finally arrested as his Empire crumbled."
La French,"For the story itself, all I can say is that it was about time to have a cinematic film about the rise and the downfall of the French heroin connection based in the 1970s. Watching the same old Sopranos could not compete with this breed of Gangsterism due to the fact that 'The Connection' focused on the sociological theme. The content was unique, because I was getting bored watching the same old Italian wise guys like 'Goodfellas', 'Mean Streets' and 'The Sopranos.' Those three titles do not go into political depth. Cinema needs more genres which are so different."
La French,"All in all, I give this film a solid.. 8/10."
La French,Solid French cinema- this would be the ultra-short version.
La French,"Even though the movie is being categorised as action and a thriller, in reality it is more of a drama and a biopic. Set in the time frame of 1975 to 1981 it details the struggle between the French police and the the mob. What is now commonly known as the French Connection (the way drugs were smuggled from Turkey to Marseille, refined and repacked there and then shipped off to the U.S.), serves as the backdrop for this movie. On the one hand there is the gang of mobsters (hence the name La French) on the other a special task force dealing with organised crime. Pierre Michel, a magistrate attached to this task force, goes all in to battle the current boss 'Tany' Zampa."
La French,"But as said, it's not a flashy action flick. Michele is portrayed as a driven, obsessed man - it is implied that he had some gambling problems in the past - who seems to be actually trying to catch the 'bad guys'. During the entirety of the movie his determination is being shown as close to obsession as possible without too much cliché. It is obvious that his obsession will get him into trouble, sooner or later."
La French,"The entire main cast does its best to stay focused on portraying 'normal' people- with all the rational and irrational thinking that drives us. Dujardin does well in his role, even though I found some scenes a bit 'too much'. I presume the director wanted to capture as much of the emotional struggle as possible in those scenes. The movie is little over 2 hours, so IMO a few more minutes to elaborate on the emotional stress magistrate Michele was going through, would have served the movie well."
La French,"There is some action here and there, but it's neither flashy, nor heroic. It's the simple, realistic depiction of action and some graphic violence, or rather its absence, that adds to the movie. As said before, the movie is more of a drama, more focused on the characters involved and their struggles. It's one of the movies where even the antagonists have some sort of inner emotional cosmos one can actually relate to."
La French,"The movie in its entirety is sombre, a bit bleak and some parts (especially the last 10 mins) have almost a cynical undertone to them. In general there are only a few lighter parts. And that all while being filmed in southern France, ie. it's almost sunny all the time- some shots underline this contrast very nicely: Michele and Zampa meet on an outcrop while the sun is slowly setting in the background."
La French,"All those little bits and pieces add up to very solid drama; no light fare, to be sure. Give it a go if you're into Eurocinema."
La French,"Finishing the last ep of the very good Sci-Fi Noir series Fortitude,I got set to catch up on movie viewings. Taking a look at titles about to leave Netflix UK,I was surprised to see a ""serious"" movie starring The Artist actor Jean Dujardin,which led to me making the connection."
La French,The plot-
La French,1970s Marseille:
La French,"Calling themselves ""La French"" the gang led by Gaètan Tany Zampa becomes a major exporter of heroin into New York,which leads to US police going after the French Connection. Transferred to an organised crime unit, Former Juvenile Court judge Pierre Michel finds the gang to be running rings round the department. Getting info of the gang from a teen addict,Michel sets his sights on cutting the ""octopus' arms"" of Zampa,and discovers that this octopus will not lets its connections be cut easily,when the informant teen is found murdered."
La French,View on the film:
La French,"Following the other side of the investigation not shown in The French Connection,co-writer/(with Audrey Diwan) director Cédric Jimenez & cinematographer Laurent Tangy get into the spirit of things with the Gaumont 70's logo being used,and followed with sharp-suits,smoke- filled police stations, changing surveillance tech,neon disco lights and short,blunt shots of violence. Untangling each La French octopus arm, Jimenez stylishly uses hand-held (but not shaky cam) camera moves to give the title a gritty,Noir documentary appearance,as Jimenez keeps up with the cops finding hideouts in the rugged countryside."
La French,"Pushing his fellow cops to get results,the screenplay by Jimenez and Diwan tensely place all the pressure on Noir rebel Michel,which sets the fuse for abrupt exchanges with Michel and his family,as he becomes consumed with breaking the French Connection. Initially outsmarting the police at every turn,the writers give Zampa a delicious smugness,which melts away as Zampa's ice cool confidence turns to doubt. ""Ripped from the headlines"" the writers give the across the years' war between Michel and Zampa a superb urgency,where each setback sends the other one off the rails."
La French,"Not being in the mood to take Uggie (RIP) for walkies, Jean Dujardin gives a fantastic performance as Michel,whose Noir obsession to capture Zampa crackles with a simmering thirst for justice from Dujardin. Dancing without a care in the world in his discos, Gilles Lellouche gives an excellent performance as Zampa,whose calm shell Lellouche chips away to reveal a sharp viciousness,as the connection is made."
La French,"If I could only recommend you go and see one film this year, The Connection would be it."
La French,"The film follows the true story of the rise and fall of Pierre Michel ""The Judge"", played by The Artist's Oscar winning Jean Dujardin, against the Marseillaise mafia gang The French Connection in the 1970s. The story had already been put to cinema in The Judge (1984), but this time the story's been redone much more ambitiously."
La French,"It's a typical good guy versus bad guy story, but it's the bells and whistles in this film that really make it so much more than that. The director achieves the perfect combination of action, drama, comedy and tragedy with the irrepressible Mediterranean sun beating down on every day time scene in the film. The Mediterranean settings give the film a sense of glamour and surrealism, juxtaposing the surreal nature of life as a successful drug trafficker in the 1970s, passing time between seaside villas and the biggest nightclub in Marseille."
La French,"This is film making at its best - it's as if the screen writer and director Cédric Jimenez pulled out an old school book of film making craft written in the 1970s and followed all the old rules to perfection to bring about not only a brilliant piece of cinematic entertainment, but also of art. This film is a living, breathing and intimate nostalgic reinvention of the 1970s and a just and accurate portrayal of a real gangster story, with some liberties in representing the character's private lives."
La French,"Cédric Jimenez grew up himself in Marseille in the 1970s and says that the story of the Judge has run through his veins his whole life. He has wanted to make this film as long as he has wanted to be a film maker, starting his career initially as a documentary maker. He chose to shoot the whole film with a hand held camera, which gives the film it's intimate and raw feeling."
La French,"It is an absolute viewing pleasure to be immersed back into the 1970s era and the sets and costumes have been rendered to perfection, to every last detail. The velour furniture, the dingy nightclubs, the glamorous dresses and old style police surveillance technologies are a delight to rediscover. The cowboy style of policing in the 1970s makes the action scenes much more exciting than anything depicting the risk-averse 2000s - the only person in the film wearing even a bullet proof vest is the gang leader Gaëtan ""Tany"" Zamper (Gilles Lellouche)."
La French,"There are countless unforgettable scenes in this film, the dialogue is witty, the action is edgy and the acting is superb. Another highlight is the film's soundtrack featuring endless classics from the 1970s (Blondie, Kim Wilde and the Velvet Underground) and tunes by composer Guillaume Roussel that reflect the film soundtracks of the time (for example, his tune Meurtre de fou). It can be tough to watch a sub-titled film for 2h15min, but believe me it's worth it."
La French,"Another great policier from La Belle France where they continue to make films about PEOPLE and seemingly never heard of cgi, streets named Elm or Men in black. The two leads are both more or less playing against type; Dujardin starred in two COMICAL crime capers as an inept James Bond figure, Lellouche is more often on the receiving end of violence than generating it and they co-starred memorably in a comedy a couple of years back. Here, Dujardin in Eliot Ness mode fronts a unit to bring down not a beer but a drugs trafficker (Lellouche) and like Ness has a serious family life going for him. Aptly for a movie set in Marseilles one of the supporting players is Gerard Meylan, a regular member in Robert Guideguin's repertory company and like the entire cast he is more than up to snuff. There well may be those who will groan not ANOTHER Gallic gangster film and that of course is their right and they can't touch you for it but the rest of us will, I suspect, wallow in yet another great policier."
La French,"In the late 1960s and early 1970s drugs were flowing from Marseille to New York in a sophisticated and sustained operation. The Americans made two movies about the racket: ""The French Connection"" (1971) set in New York and ""The French Connection II"" (1975) located in Marseiiles, in both cases with Gene Hackman famously playing the police crime-buster. French cinema too has had two cracks at telling the story: first with ""The Judge"" (1984) and then with ""The Connection"" (""La French"" in French) in 2014."
La French,"In the French films, the hero is not a policeman but a magistrate, in ""The Connection"" played by played by Jean Dujardin, best known outside France for his performance in the silent film ""The Artist"". The role of the chief criminal is taken by Gilles Lelouche. There is a short scene where the two meet alone which is reminiscent of the cafe scene between Al Pacino and Robert de Niro in ""Heat"". ""The Connection"" is not one of the the classics like ""The French Connection"" and ""Heat"" but it is a stylish, if clichéd, thriller with hand-held camera-work and atmospheric soundtrack adding to the impact."
La French,"This really could have been made in the 70s. It does feel like it from beginning til the end. It's also the spiritual ""brother"" (or partner in crime if you forgive the pun) of the ""French Connection"". And while the first FC played in America and the second was based in France, this plays entirely in France and shows what the French were doing in the war against drugs."
La French,"Jean Dujardin has proved, that he is more than just a comedic actor, he has the charisma to pull any role off, even this tough one. But he has some more than solid french talent to help him along the way. It's bleak, it's tension filled and it does not disappoint at all. Though I'm sure some will have issues with the ending, but you can't please everyone"
La French,"Great settings, acting, actors, soundtrack and camerawork. Complications of plot at times (who's who?) didn't hide inevitably of ending. Also unfamiliar with French justice and political systems. But well worth the watch - I couldn't leave it before the end - especially for the two lead actors. Best French movie to come along for a while. Also called The Connection. (viewed 8/16)"
La French,"""The Connection"" is a dull crime flick with many of the usual clichés, eg. A cop who can't do what he needs to do to catch the bad guy because of the bureaucracy in his way, and his obsession with the case straining his home life and making his wife leave him. How many times have we seen these things, and through the lens of a wobbly camera to boot?"
La French,The main character is a cliché and it is impossible to care anything about him. Instead I felt sorry for the actor trying his darnedest with material so trite.
La French,"In one scene the cops arrest a guy who was just about to kill the bad guy for them. The movie doesn't even acknowledge this. It's like it's on a completely different page to the viewer. If you were police after a crimelord, and you had to stop someone you knew was probably going to kill the crimelord and himself in the process, wouldn't you be a bit frustrated that the constraints of your job stopped you from letting one problem solve another? Wouldn't the crimelord express mocking gratitude? This was a point of connection with the audience the movie squanders completely."
La French,"One of the few interesting points in this movie is that the actor playing the good guy and the actor playing the bad guy look almost identical. I couldn't tell them apart. They have the same features, same haircut, everything. The bad guy is slightly shorter than the good guy. That was my only way of telling them apart."
La French,"As for telling the movie apart from any other cops vs criminals movie, you're on your own. It's French, if that helps."
La French,"A fairly truthful representation of an actual event that occurred in the city of Marseilles.Even though a lot of facts are edited and added for the dramatic aspect of the movie it clearly paints a magnificent image of the city in the 1970's when the ruling mafia was not like the bandit-ism of today but a far more elegant and sophisticated type. The typical accent of a ""marseillais"" (person from Marseilles) is heard and is very accurate, Jean Dujardin plays his role superbly as the detective and proves his caliber as on of the best french actors in the current industry. Overall a flawless production, the spectator is captivated all along and his heart beats for the main characters risky path towards breaking down the ""French Connection""."
La French,"I watched this movie and was impressed by a solid story line (it is not your average crime movie), the good actors and the attention for detail. As another reviewer wrote, you should really see especially if you want an impression of what a good French movie consists of."
La French,"THE CONNECTION is a gritty slice of French crime which, as the title would suggest, is based on much the same story as the famous FRENCH CONNECTION by William Friedkin. The story follows a dedicated judge who makes it his business to bring down a heroin kingpin, played by the excellent Giles Lellouche, an actor I better known playing the hero in the likes of POINT BLANK and MEA CULPA. This is a downbeat film full of sudden bursts of violence and a very fast pace so that you never get bored by the familiarity of the genre ingredients. It's also gritty and realistic, and has a good balance between character relationships, plot, and breakneck thrills. It might not be the most original film out there, but it's a film which achieves what it seeks to do, and it's a solid, engaging achievement."
La French,"Beautiful setting in Marseille in the 1970s. Beautiful cars. Beautiful people. This movie does not delve into the sad and depressing elements seen in Casino and Scarface, so it could be criticized as lacking realism. For me, this movie is the 70s without the stagflation and the horrible avocado-green kitchen appliances. I don't even think we see any shag carpet. Visually, this movie is unsurpassed, the plot moves along smartly with a few shootouts but not very much tension. The men wear suits and look like adults. Every frame is beautiful. No fat slobs with tattoos spoil this movie."
La French,This is not an American crime thriller. I wish this movie does not get clouded with cheap thrillers. A gem. An art this is. What a great movie. Dujardin and Lellouche trying to excel each other in characterization. Lellouche wins I think. The last 30 minutes of the movie... a master piece. One wants to slip away. One wants to pin down. This movie portrays the emotional part of both. Very artistically. Hats off to the director and team. A Beautiful movie. An art :)
La French,"Céline Sallette did a very good job here. Few scenes, I can see her best. Generally, other than the main two, it is almost good if not best. Very good performance. Very good movie. Very unlike the Amreican movies."
La French,"In this gritty crime drama, the time is 1975, and the place is Marseilles, the epicenter of the drug trafficking business run by the notorious overlord Gaëtan 'Tany' Zampa. The film tells the story of the famous French Connection."
La French,"There was a conscious attempt on the part of the French filmmakers to pay homage to and even recreate the grainy style of the famous Gene Hackman film ""The French Connection."" The scenes shot in America especially recall the brilliant style of director William Friedkin."
La French,"Jean Dujardin plays the role of the French magistrate Pierre Michel. While he does not have the colorful character traits of Hackman's iconic Popeye Doyle, Dujardin creates a judge of stature and dignity, as well as humanity. Some of the most moving scenes in the film were those of Michel's association with a young drug addict and his touching relationship with his wife and daughters."
La French,"While the film lacks the fast-paced and suspenseful style of ""The French Connection,"" the French version nonetheless conveys the struggle of bringing the members drug cartel to justice. The filmmakers were not entirely successful in bringing the humanity out of Zampa by portraying him as a caring family man."
La French,"The devastating effects of the widespread drug trafficking tended to get lost after the young addict Lilly dropped out of the film due to an alleged overdose. It was more likely that she was dispatched by the Zampa organization. Apart from Lilly, Michel, and Zampa, the cops and the thugs tended to blend together too much in this ambitious and sprawling crime exposé."
La French,"The trailer got me really interested, especially because it seemed to promise a fierce duel between Dujardin & Lellouche, not unlike the memorable Al Pacino/De Niro duel in ""Heat"", which I still consider to be the absolute best gangster movie ever! Well, it didn't really deliver on those promises... Dujardin was great as a relentless judge, but unfortunately I thought that Lellouche lacked the kind of machismo and presence that would have made him a strong opponent to Dujardin. He wasn't convincing as a feared and respected drug kingpin. Without what should have been its strongest point, the film fails to keep us interested, mainly because of its uninspired plot and dialogs as well as its length. Because of all this, ""La French"" feels like a missed opportunity. Too bad, I really wanted to love this one! If you wanna watch a great french gangster movie, I recommend ""L'immortel"" or ""Truands"". 6/10"
La French,In a way I was disappointed after seeing La French. The (real) story is gripping. I remember Marseille in the 70's was known as a dangerous place. You had to watch your steps. The French Connection was in the wrong way famous. And the murder on the judge was brutal. Only in the last 30 minutes La French will give you this feeling of drama. Before that the story is quite flat and cliché. It lacks the French grandeur and depth.
La French,"Gilles Lellouche is a miscast as the main criminal. He is just too friendly in his looks and deeds (I agree with another reviewer). Jean Dujardin is good as always, but not brilliant. Celine Sallette is OK, but can do more. She has to play the terrible role of the wife, who leaves her husband because he is too busy with his work. But on the street after Jean Dujardin was shot, she is convincing."
La French,"Also the atmosphere and the cinematography are very good. Real 70's. And the film is cut fast. So, there are a lot of good things, but they can't compensate the poor scenario and miscast of Gilles Lellouche. La French could and should have been better. I give it a 6/10, because of the importance of the real story behind it."
La French,This movie leaves one with the impression that the team shot a 4 hours long movie and then quickly had to cut it to 2. And that they then lost interest and just snipped it like a bored and failing student would do to a assignment that has to be in tomorrow. The result is that there are loose ends flapping all over the show and that many - sometimes crucial - plot developments are not sufficiently clear. It also suffers from too many sub plots that really does not contribute to moving the story forward. And the worst thing - it starts off with some promise. Which means one keeps on watching for far too long. In the end I finished watching it merely because I have been watching it for so long and to make sure it really is such a failed movie. But I did get one thing from it - I realised how important casting is. The crook and the hero look alike (unintentionally ... I think...)with the result one must work to follow which one is in frame. In the end a failed and boring movie with a stale plot.
La French,"To be honest, I was convinced for most of this film that it was a made-for-tv movie. There were so many cookie-cutter crime procedural tropes strewn throughout. A good made-for-tv movie, but still a made-for-tv movie, was my impression. Instead, I just learned from imdb that this creation is more like a biopic, for it is based on the true story of organized heroin traffic and a magistrate who fought to stop it in Marseille. Knowing that, I suppose that it's perhaps closer to one of the films about Pedro Escobar than anything else. Not bad, but not great, and apparently somewhat educational."
La French,"In the many reviews and description of the movie, it is mentioned that Pierre Michel is a detective. That is wrong. Pierre Michel was a judge, which is very different from a detective. Was Pierre Michel doing a detective work? Well it could be considered as yes, but his main work position was being a judge."
La French,"I have to say that I was really looking forward to this one. The disappointment was big. It's weak and sloppy, trying real hard to be something it will never be."
La French,La French is a film that basically wants to be hardcore and truthful but fails miserably. The director is obviously more comfortable with clichés than with the real deal. Each scene is a rip- off from other scenes taken from previous crime classics. But poorly done.
La French,"The film has quite a budget, but it doesn't have any soul at all. Its makers obviously confuse money with quality. If you are a fan of Jean Dujardin, you will be very much disappointed. He deserved a better role."
La French,"All dressed up but nowhere to go, La French is far from being the crime classic it tries to be. This is not the French Connection or The Godfather. Just a generic product disguised as a quality film."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Dragon Blade is a fun, undemanding historical epic based upon a true story. The true story is that there was a Roman Empire, China exists and there was a Silk Road. Beyond that the film is an historical fantasy based around a Roman General on the run with the blind son of a consul and a few loyal men. He meets the disgraced Captain of a border patrol and together they..... well the plot really isn't important.
Basically Jackie Chan joins forces with John Cusack to defeat the evil Adrien Brody. There are lots of set pieces, good stunt work and some fun battles. Jackie Chan is funny, heroic and dependable as always in the lead role. Adrien Brody is suitably villainous and John Cusack plays John Cusack. It's not something worth going out of your way to watch but if it's on, Dragon Blade is a fun bit of mindless entertainment."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"DRAGON BLADE isn't a great film at all, but given that the previous Jackie Chan film I watched was Chinese ZODIAC, it seems somewhat acceptable by comparison. Certainly it's a messy movie, which is typical of Jackie's more recent efforts, but it has some good stuff included alongside all of the tat. The story is supposedly based on historical fact and involves some Roman soldiers who traverse the Silk Road and find themselves in China. They're split into two factions, the small number of good guys and the overwhelming bad, and the good guys end up joining forces with Jackie and his men to fight the enemy. What DRAGON BLADE boils down to is a heady mix of laughable sentiment, Chinese comedy, war and battle sequences, and some very bad acting."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Jackie himself doesn't really seem to do much that's new in this film. The director throws in a few of his old-fashioned fight scenes to recall his glory days, and while the action is acceptable, it's never memorable. It's the western actors who do surprisingly well: Adrien Brody as the quietly menacing villain, and John Cusack as the likable ally. Some of the set-piece sequences are well-handled, like the building of the defences, and the large-scale action at the climax is quite a lot of fun. I was glad to see that director Daniel Lee has calmed down since the days of DRAGON SQUAD and can now direct reasonable fare like this and THREE KINGDOMS: RESURRECTION OF THE DRAGON. DRAGON BLADE isn't perfect by any means, but there's a good film hiding underneath the mish-mash of styles and ideas."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Amazing that something like this would do over $100 million in China, especially considering that I believe movie tickets there are roughly $5. First the good. This is probably the most expensive set and costume design I have ever seen in a martial arts flick, that is why it got 2 stars. If you like sword fighting, then you might enjoy this. Now for the bad, quite the long list. LOTS of subtitles, including signs and songs, probably 70% of the movie is in Chinese. Yes SONGS, I guess they are supposed to be inspiring or something. The movie opens with two guys sticking their swords in the ground as a truce, then shortly after that those two guys stand off for a ""fight to the death, no way to avoid it"" situation. Boy, I wonder who is gonna win? Why would you put a flash forward to ruin that scene? That is typical to the way this thing is put together. To top it off, the plot makes zero sense. Chan and his men are sentenced to hard labor rebuilding a city on the Great Wall, within 10 minutes of getting there Chan is now in charge? WTF? All of a sudden they have 15 days to rebuild giant stone walls and buildings or they will be executed. This is supposed to be 50 BC and the work they have to do would take a modern crew of 100 masons probably 3 months or more. But with the help of the Romans, we can do it! What a crock. And in the middle of this building frenzy, Chan decides to have his guys put on a demo of their martial arts, so the Romans also do a demonstration, followed by two individual stick battles, followed by a Roman giving a Chinese guy a sword because it was a great fight. WTF AGAIN! Yes they are supposed to be bonding, but it is just stupid. And over and over, like it was written by a 5th grader with ADHD. Not buying John Cusack or Adrian Brody as top class soldiers either, sorry guys, even though the use of stunt doubles is not obvious. Half the time during fights everyone is just slapping the other guy with their swords. Even the fake blood looks like raspberry jam for some reason, making that look real is not tough to do. Chan accidentally removes some important lady's scarf while she is trying to kill him, so he MUST apologize, when he does so in private, she drops everything to be naked in front of him, what? He of course does his awkward embarrassed act and backs away, that seems like an even bigger insult to me, but I guess NOT! The Roman kid could not be more annoying, what an incredibly lame plot device, egads. I think you get the idea, don't bother unless you really like lavish sets with sword fighting. I think the sign at the end: ""make friends from enemies"" is supposed to be the moral of the story or some crap, but the entire thing is pointless. Maybe it should read ""How I turned a Million Dollars in Real Estate into $100 in Cash"", to steal a joke from Steve Martin."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"At first I thought it was going to be the sort of romp seen in previous Jackie Chan movies with plenty of tongue in cheek and humour punctuated action. However about a third of the way through I began to realise that this movie is actually trying to be serious in spite of the appalling script and ridiculous plot. The messages it tries to send about friendship, race relations and honour are naive, if not childish, in their portrayal and out of context in the attempted Machiavellian machinations in the storyline. By the end of the film, I was overloaded with cliché and plot twists as untwisty and transparent as to be eye-wateringly unbelievable in their absurdity. On numerous occasions throughout the movie I felt embarrassed for actors such as Adrian Brody and John Cusack and wondered how they would explain their part in such drivel to their friends and relatives without dying of shame. I can only imagine the money they earned was worth the ridicule should their participation in this abomination become widely known. I'm now going to go and curl up in a ball, rock gently backwards and forwards and try to forget having been assaulted with over two hours of this equine excrement."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"If ever anyone in the history of cinema has earned 2 hours of my life, it's Jackie Chan. Unfortunately, I was repaid this sentiment with two of the most horrible hours of cinema made in recent years."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"When I heard of Romans fighting it out in the Silk Road, I liked the idea. But instead the film starts out with two Chinese historians (who speak English, naturally, since this is aimed at an international audience) searching for a lost city that the Romans built. The beginning is bad... ominously bad, and it only gets worse from there."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Rewind 2,000 years and with the tone set for a serious affair, until Jackie Chan adopts his usual ""stunt-fu"" in a fight scene completely out of place, but hey, it's Jackie Chan, so carry on."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Enter the Romans... John Cusack is his usual self but he seems to be accompanied by two of the most horrendous actors I've seen, in the guise of a child would-be Emporor and his male nanny. Actually, aside from Brody, Cusack and one or two Centurians, pretty much everyone who speaks English will make you cringe with how god-awful their ""talent"" is."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Anyway, the script's a total mess and for long periods, is actually very boring. Brody turns up as some power-craved maniac Emporor who didn't need to do anything bad since he was always going to be the Emporor anyway, and then we have a battle and, thankfully, the film ends."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Only, it doesn't. Instead, it goes back to the historian couple who enjoy the romantic scenery of the few sand-blasted columns remaining upright before they illogically announce that they'll never share their discovery, even though it's the whole point of their very existence!"
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Sigh. This film is just bad, illogical and painful and unless you're a die-hard Jackie Chan fan, I implore you to avoid it. For those of you who are Jackie Chan fans, just know that this is one of - if not THE worst film he's ever made and ask yourself: ""Do you really want to taint your opinion of the great man by sitting through this?"""
Tian jiang xiong shi,"While the main message of the movie was about multi-cultural peace (probably what the world needs now), choreography was good (nothing less than expected from a J.C. movie), side jokes to make you giggle from this otherwise boring plot, nothing else about the movie was able to redeem it from it's cliché story progression and bad script."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"1) The message about multicultural peace was smacked right in audience faces left, right, up, down from the beginning of the show. To make things worst, coupled with cheesy lines, it made a profound and wise motif seem plain cheesy, overly-simplified and lacked the depth it should have had."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"2) Despite the strong development of major characters, minor/side characters were not grounded enough. Fickle change in beliefs by side characters (people of the Wild Geese Gate), once again, made the story look superficial and badly developed."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Unfortunately, great choreography, scene shots and strong casts could not save it from its draggy, underdeveloped plot and horrible script."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"I've read some of the reviews -- the bad reviews, I generally agree more, the good ones were often too exaggerated. Although I am not a master of the Chinese language, I'm able to understand both English and Chinese movies without subtitles, so I'd like to first address the title. I've no problem with the English title, whatsoever, but to the reviewer who said that it has something to do with lions? He's WRONG. If you want me to translate it, it's something along the lines of Top Gererals, Brave (Mightly) Armies (Troops)."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Now, to my review. First, the good. The actors were good. The fight choreography was good. The cgi was good. That's pretty much it!"
Tian jiang xiong shi,"So, what was so wrong about the movie? The message of the movie is simple, to promote harmony among people despite the obvious differences in race, ethnicity, culture, creed, etc, etc. I get that! I have nothing against that either. The challenge however, is to incorporate that message seamlessly into the story without it feeling too forced or cliché -- and that was exactly how I felt when I watched some of those scenes."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"But the bigger failure... is that the story makes absolutely no sense at all. It makes no sense to me how easily they could move and deploy their armies along the Silk Road from Rome to China or vice-versa. It makes no sense that they were all able to understand a common language, that is English. In ancient China, Chinese don't speak a common Chinese language, they speak different dialects. And if you add to the mix, the European languages, and the Middle Eastern languages, there is just no common ground in there for them to be able to understand each other."
Tian jiang xiong shi,It makes no sense that Jackie Chan is so trusty from the start (almost like a fool). It makes no sense that Adrien Brody would (for the sake of not spoiling) find himself eventually in that predicament. A lot of things that happened in between didn't make hell of a lot of sense either...
Tian jiang xiong shi,"I was invited to go see the Jackie Chan/Adrian Brody/John Cusack Chinese pseudo-historical period drama called Dragon Blade(though its Chinese title is more along the lines of ""Day of the Lion"" and has nothing to do with dragons or lions... confused yet? Just wait...)."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"In it Jackie Chan plays a guard commander on the Silk Road who absolutely refuses to use violence, which pretty much makes him the worst guard ever. John Cusack plays a super-tired looking Roman General on the run leading a Legion who all speak English but have what is supposed to be a stirring Roman ""national anthem"" which is in Latin. Oh, and even though it's the year 458 BC, Jackie Chan can still speak English... but more Chingrishy than usual (cringing intensifies). Adrian Brody plays a ridiculously evil Consul and was developed by someone who had absolutely no idea what a Roman Consul was and thought it was hereditary, thereby necessitating he kill his father and blind his little brother so that ""he could never take power."" Seriously, dude. You have to get elected every year... and usually have to wait 10 before running again... sigh... ."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Consul Brody marches an army of 100,000 to conquer the Silk Road which is apparently about a day's hike even though it's like 8,000 miles away. Captain Chan and General Cusack strike up an unlikely and utterly unconvincing friendship to rebuild a city's outer walls, the Romans show how ""smart"" they are by wasting half their schedule constructing huge machines to do the work instead of using the ample labor supply available (it is, after all, a labor camp). The Legion and the ""Silk Road Protection Squad"" have what I thought of as a ""Bring It On"" style dance-off using their respective military drills, than that goes into a sparring match, and then hugs all around. And then they have a singing competition. No. Seriously. They have a singing competition... with a blind kid. In Latin. I made none of this up. ."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Jackie Chan intermittently goes from being a super-boring goof ball a la everything Chan's ever been in... to the film randomly cutting back to confusing, only-semi-explained flashbacks to when he accidentally suffocated his sister to death as a child, and then stabbed a general in the side who tried to comfort him... all of this leading (somehow) to his deciding to protect the Silk Road using the power of nonviolence forever."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Then the ""bad"" Romans show up and the movie turns a 180 and goes into hyper-drive blood, death, and gore. That little blind kid? Thrown off the top of the city wall. John Cusack gets his eyes cut out, is crucified, and then is ""mercifully"" ended by Jackie Chan who breaks form to but an arrow through his neck (he then goes back to letting pretty much any and everyone kill for him and on his behalf until the end). Chan's impossibly-saintly teacher-wife takes 2 arrows in the back. There's a random, gruesome extreme closeup of a Roman soldier taking a Hun arrow in the face *through* a wooden plank. Huns (including the super-hot Lin Peng as Cold Moon), and 30-something other ""races"" all join together to fight the Eeevul Cosul Adrian Brody, and it's like something directly out of The Hobbit #3 with a flipping horde of eagles gouging eyes out, and doomed last stands. ."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Adrian Brody stabs his grandfather and almost beheads Jackie Chan, but then Chan does something with the weird little arm guard he's worn the whole movie (even though his whole squad is shown to practice with sweet swords that can be thrown and retracted, they are used once, ONCE the whole film. Brody gets his neck slashed, but opt to keep Jackie's kill could at 1 by then taking his dagger and stabbing himself in the heart while mumbling the (completely made up) Roman national anthem again. Then the remaining Romans and the member of the 30-whatever nations all join up to keep the SIlk Road safe and war-free for everyone. ."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"The film is bookended by explorers who find the ruins of the city, and then decide not to tell anyone and keep it a secret... *even though that's their whole job. Their ONLY job.* ."
Tian jiang xiong shi,The End. .
Tian jiang xiong shi,"I haven't seen a movie this unfocused, confused, and just... bad... in a long while. If you find yourself in my position, with someone offering you a free ticket... Just. Say. No. Say no to terrible cinematography."
Tian jiang xiong shi,. I wish I had extra hands so I could give this movie four thumbs down.
Tian jiang xiong shi,"This kind of film truly reminds me why I enjoy Asian cinema. This take here...the mix of martial arts and Jackie Chan, Jet Li kind of sword play (typical Chinese which as awesome), mixed cast from various nations to throw in so many nations and trifles in just 2 hours and actually not make it feel rushed nor boring at ANY time whatsoever. Now that is something I find truly impressive and extremely refreshing."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Jackie Chan as this peaceful and helpful man who seeks to create peace and assist others. ""Turn foes into friends"" as the movie so eloquently states in the end. John Cusack as the Roman General on the run with the young brother of another roman general (adrien Brody who's the bad guy here which he does a wonderful job portraying) Various other people ending up to join the fray of power, greed, jealousy and so much more. It's all great, people! It's great entertainment and it keeps you interested and captivated through each step of the film. It makes you pumped up during the fight sequences which are very well done, effects, costumes and basically the visuals of this are astounding. Its a beautiful and yet raw looking film. Gritty...which really allows you to immersive yourself into this epic...and I stress that word...EPIC film."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"I personally see this as a definitive 8 out of 10. Its more than good. Its more than great. It's in my opinion flat out fantastic and most of all so because it has GREAT replay value. Its entertaining, captivating, got great action, ambitious and passionate story, great cast and it is filmed very very well."
Tian jiang xiong shi,Definitely worth a watch AT LEAST once. Wonderful film. I'm very happy I decided to watch this one. There are so many big budget films nowadays that simply are so heavy and dragged out in their story telling and basically you'll watch it once...walk away without air in your lungs not because you're blown away...but because you are literally exhausted just watching the same...old...boring...cliché story.
Tian jiang xiong shi,"THIS... strays from all of that! And thus I'm rating it 8. Damn good film, people. Another thing is also you never get the weird feeling that Jackie Chan who's quite the comedy actor is here as the action hero. Quite the contrary he makes it work extremely well. Sure he has some funny scenes and he makes the action super good like you'd expect. But overall...he's doing damn good in this kind of film."
Tian jiang xiong shi,Daniel Lee. Thank you so much for making this film. And thanks to all who helped and participated.
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Inspired by the story of a roman legion which vanished attacking the Parthian empire in 50 BC, this is a tale of civilizations clashing on the silk road. Huo An (Jackie Chan) leads the Silk Road Protection Squad which tries to keep the peace among the warring factions. They are framed for gold smuggling and sentenced to prison work detail at the Wild Geese Gate. Lucius (John Cusack) leads his Legion to the gate with a blind boy named Publius. They are on the run from Publius' murderous brother Tiberius (Adrien Brody)."
Tian jiang xiong shi,There continues to be an effort to sell Chinese movies by adding Hollywood elements. This has led to bending and twisting stories to accommodate the additions. The stories feel artificial and manufactured. It's a mess of clunky muddle. There are some nice battle scenes in this one. They are wild fun action but this movie is immediately forgettable.
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Epic historical war movies are easily marketable, they have a certain hook to captivate audience, especially when big budget and A-list actors are involved. Dragon Blade couples together many aspects from similar movies. With its grand production some of these work fairly well. However, it tries too hard to please viewers with inept script and poor direction that the movie becomes unoriginal, even to the point of cringe-worthy."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Huo An (Jackie Chan) is an officer of Silk Road tasked to maintain peace in a land divided by many countries. Soon, he's drawn by the turmoil and political struggle as conspiracy of Roman Empire knocks on his door step. The story admittedly has merits, there are a few subplots that are decent enough, although the pacing drags on way too much on unity issue. The main message that it wants to push is how many tribes or Silk Road can exist, this could be a great if the movie doesn't consistently shove it in the most heavy-handed way."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Jackie Chan is a star in his own right. He's not that well versed in acting, but audience would know what to expect at this point. John Cusack holds his own, but frankly he's not very interesting. The choice for child actor isn't that great either, this is an obvious bait to draw audience sympathy. Still, some of the Chinese actors are pretty good as they look more natural. Props to Adrien Brody, he alone raises the acting level. A beastly antagonist, he delivers a menacing on-screen persona."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"For setting and costumes, the movie puts a lot of effort. Design is flamboyant, it almost looks like a high profile video game set. Each character has their distinct look which is quite appealing to showcase diversity. Choreography is fine as well, this is a strong point of Chinese movie. The fights are engaging with many details in movement, meticulous array of gimmick and different fighting style. At least it got the warfare department covered."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Cinematography, on the other hand, is bad till the point of cringe-worthy. The scenes are badly paced and often recycled, some scenes are even needlessly repeated several times. There's no logic on flashback of events that just occurred, it doesn't add to emotional value, instead it makes the movie that much boring. It also spams slow motion in insufferable rate, not to mention with overly aggressive soundtracks that attempt to sell the scenes with cheesy tone. It's as if the movie is constantly yelling, ""Intense! Emotion! Sadness!"""
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Dragon Blade is an odd endeavor in epic historical film, it copies too many aspects of already known formula in hope that the success can be transmitted here. It has choppy direction and all sorts of issues, but the movie sometimes brings some good elements, which might just be enough for light entertainment."
Tian jiang xiong shi,I wont describe the actual movie here as you will be able to read other reviews already published. I will however will try to avoid you suffering the pain I have just gone through.
Tian jiang xiong shi,"I was very disappointed in this movie, perhaps because I expected better from a movie with John Cusack, Adrien Brody, Jackie Chan. Perhaps I should have looked at who was directing the movie such as Daniel Lee and the typical movies he has made.... or maybe it was because the movie was just ""really"" bad."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"I watched the movie on a quiet Wednesday night and I would estimate that a third of the audience left well before the end, some really early. When the credits came up it was like a fire evacuation alert had just came on. Please, Women and Children first.. We will all survive!"
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Jackie Chan fight scenes were well below par and I thought they were more like a ""Charlie Chaplin/Harold Loyd"" Silent movie style rather than a ""Rush Hour"" style."
Tian jiang xiong shi,John Cusack character was extremely boring and I could have fallen asleep in I was at home.
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Adrien Brody was the only positive in the movie, but the movie was so bad that his acting was lost."
Tian jiang xiong shi,The child actor was badly filmed (always) like an old Asian hero film and I found the child annoying.
Tian jiang xiong shi,The production and cinematography of the film are cringe-worthy throughout. flashbacks are random and not in line with story. Slow motions are extensive and really annoying.
Tian jiang xiong shi,Recommendation - Go and see something else.
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Probably to almost anyone, seeing the trailer of Dragon Blade for a couple of times might piqued your interest, especially when you see a couple of A-list actors and actresses in it. Most notably are Jackie Chan, John Cusack, Adrien Brody and Choi Si Won (one of ex-member from K-Pop band, Super Junior)."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"While most of the review I've seen here is pretty much saying this one is an utter disappointment, I for myself personally don't think so."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"To me, Jackie Chan along with Daniel Lee has managed to pull this out quite remarkably. Their choices for the actors are good, because each one of 'em could play the role nicely. They could get into their role so deep, you would think they were re-enacting a piece of story from their personal life."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Maybe there is a couple of flaws here and there, like the ruin in the very beginning of the show that's not old enough and for another keen eyes, this might kill the mood, because basically, we were promised a story that (might) happened thousand years ago. But truth be told, it was not really a problem, since the ruin itself is just a fake one, created to fit into the real story of Silk Road."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Story-wise, some of you might find it cheesy and predictable. Some of you might even say that the character Chan played (Huo An), was unbelievably too kind, like he was just character from a fairytale. Is it really like that? If you follow the story and try to delve into the character of Huo An, to every tragedy ever happened to him (told in the story), you might understand why he always talk about peace."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Or maybe how Cusack was not cut out for the role of Roman Empire general, Lucius? Don't think so. He actually played the role real good, he could showed how it feels to be betrayed, to hate and to trust. Brody as the villain Tiberius, has also done a very great job. You could see his character in a whole new way, the way he lust for power and ambitions. The twisted way of a mad man ready to betray (and kill, as already told in the trailer) his own family."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"How about the fight and the war scenes or any other details? I won't go into more detail about those topics and it's best if you go watch it yourself. You should, because as predictable as it was, the morale of the story is very touching and heartwarming."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"It's true, peace between races and nations might be a naive topic these days, but I honestly think, it is actually very nice. I think, this is how Chan convey his own ideal to the real world, about how all nations should be united and not be in conflict with each other."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"All in all, I give this movie 10/10. A must watch!"
Tian jiang xiong shi,"I manage to watch this on an airplane while I was on my way to Qatar, anyways I was a bit worried of what the outcome might be e.g. Flops like tuxedo, the medallion and the spy next door, but it turns out that it was so brilliant (guess the critics are wrong about this film. Here are some of my pros I manage to break down: *The most redeeming thingwas the fight scenes, as Jackie stated in behind the scenes promo (he wanted the fight scenes to be realistic instead of a wuxia-type fight scene) and he absolutely delivers it well, he's in his 60's so he's not a young lad anymore that can make fight scenes look fancy (or perform stunts) and tbh it fits well with his age, also it was great contrast with eastern vs western styles of fighting. *diverse location/cast-I was so surprised of how many groups were involved including Uighur, Huns, White Indians etc and also the Romans, also filmed in a beautiful desert and with no cgi what so ever. *Prop design-the scorpion sword (attaching wrist rope to sword) was pretty original and artistic at the same time, also the costume design was also artistic as well (as it wasn't very typical)."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Here are my cons: *acting-it wasn't bad nor great, it was alright but could've done a bit better. *story dragging too long-my only complaint is when it tries to get into the action, there were some boring dialogue but nothing that puts me off from the film."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Verdict: It was very interesting to see Adrien Brody to play the antagonist as he seemed to always play protagonists in previous roles. As for Jackie, he did say he wants to be a better actor so I think he should make film like this in the future minus the historical era lol."
Tian jiang xiong shi,Allow me to start by saying if you are expecting a non stop action fight film....Don't. This film is one build on story not action. The fight scenes are good but not the best for modern day film goers.
Tian jiang xiong shi,"The film depicts events on the Silk Road involving Chinese, Roman, and other countries who travel and protect this region."
Tian jiang xiong shi,I have read other reviews on here concerning this film and give it a low rating due to non-action scenes. This film is not a blow them up and add more dynamite type of film. It makes one think.
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Jackie Chan has begun a long line of historical films, that have been ranked low on his career but its these films that he is most proud of. They show a history of China and its surrounding regions that most people in the west would never hear of."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"It caught me by surprise! Not really a favorable film for critics but I did really enjoyed this film! That was really surprising. Romans, Chinese, Arabs, and Indians in this one historical epic. I mean how cool is that? I really thought this is just one of those straight to DVD kind of crap were Chan, Cusack and Brody is teaming up for an Chinese Historical Epic just for pure marketing type of sh*t. At first, OK I see JC doing his own thing making this epic into comedy or whatever, but then the tone gets too serious dramatically. I love films with good bonds and brotherhood. This is one of those films even with the most cheesiest screenplay and awkward moments, I still enjoyed watching it. And the fight scenes are very well choreographed with less shaky cams which is a good thing to me ( I hate shaky cams ). Heard this is the most expensive film ever made in China, well I never doubt of that. I can see the high production value in this. And kill me but I love the performances on this one. Cusack is okay, I know he is a really good actor, but I was surprised how great Brody in here as a villain. He is really good in this film. And Chan, he still got it! I was thinking this is the best JC comeback film yet. Overall this is a great watch for all Jackie Chan fanatics and for everyone who loves action films and historical epics with great action sequences. The good thing is, I was not bored and the pacing keeps me into it. Overall I'm pretty satisfied with it, and a must watch guilty pleasure."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Imagine a Chinese production of Flash Gordon, set in the ancient Orient, with a bit of gore and a musical set-piece. That's pretty much this film. Supposedly based on Chinese 'history', it's actually badly camouflaged propaganda (as are most of the 9 or 10 star reviews on here). I chuckled through most of it, which would have been a good thing if it was a comedy. The scale and the way it is beautifully shot are let down by the ridiculous plot, p*ss-poor dialogue and haphazard editing."
Tian jiang xiong shi,John Cusack looks like he just woke up on set and is going along with things until he can figure out how he got there.
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Jackie Chan sings. He sings a song of peace. Then he cries. Don't worry though, his little tune is sandwiched by plenty of slapstick fighting."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Adrian Brody got so immersed in his 'bad guy' role that he didn't notice how out-of-place somebody acting looks in this film. Or that nobody could be that much of an utter, utter b*stard."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"At the heart of it is a pretty simple, and noble, multicultural peace message. If you can figure out what the f**k is going on at any one time, or why anybody was fighting in the first place, then that may resonate with you."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"All in all, it's a big sloppy mess of a film."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"I'm not sure how seriously to take this movie. Not sure if it's poorly made, or genius. While the cinematography may leave something to be desired, I feel as though it's intentionally giving us that look to honor the older movies it seems influenced by. Over all an entertaining movie if you go into it with the right mindset. The fight scenes are exciting, and I kept waiting for Bruce Lee to show up, only to get shot by Clint Eastwood, while Mel Gibson rode by on his horse shouting Braveheart references. Jackie Chan continues to amaze at his age, and the other A- list actors make this movie more than worth your time. I might have to watch this one again."
Tian jiang xiong shi,Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)
Tian jiang xiong shi,Rating: 3.9/5 stars
Tian jiang xiong shi,"One of the most expensive films ever produced in China, the historical action epic, ""Dragon Blade"", takes place during the Han Dynasty. The story centers on the commander of the Protection Squad of the Western Regions (Jackie Chan), better known as the Silk Route Guard, who joins forces with Roman general Lucius (John Cusack) to protect China's sovereignty as power-crazed Tiberius (Adrien Brody) seeks to defeat Lucius, deviously plot to usurp the throne of Rome, and also gain a major foothold on the Silk Road trade route."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"""Dragon Blade"" delivers on its promise of sprawling battle scenes, meticulously crafted sword fights, intriguing culture clashes, and budding bromances, where its giddily high concept and unlikely casting may so easily have seen it fail. It's an unparalleled meeting of Eastern and Western talent. A few of the portions serenading Roman and Chinese cultures, and their union do feel somewhat frothy and indulgent, but those are minor niggles in an otherwise fantastic period action film. Director-writer Daniel Lee's historical blockbuster is entertainment on a grand scale backed up by engaging performances from Chan, Cusack, and Brody."
Tian jiang xiong shi,I was excited to see this flick with such a solid cast and interesting story. This movie was terrible.
Tian jiang xiong shi,"The story is poorly written and the dialogue is laughably bad. For the first half of the movie I had no idea what was going on, who was fighting or why, or how the Romans spoke American English! Within the first 15 minutes there are two drawn out fight sequences that make little to no sense and this is followed by a lot of fast cuts, bad dialogue, and things strung together so poorly I was like, ""What the hell is going on?"" And it never gets better. One reviewer said there is no shaky cam in the movie-- there is. Jackie acts like he always does to the point you know what's going to happen before it does. The humor falls flat and the acting is so poor form such talented actors that I got the feeling they were in this for the money."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Do not see this movie. If you want to see some good Chinese action there are much better options than this thing from everyone involved. I tried to enjoy it, but couldn't even make it through the film--I ended up stopping it about midway through."
Tian jiang xiong shi,Awful.
Tian jiang xiong shi,"I don't often review movies, and it is not my strength, though I felt the need to add my thoughts on this one."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Basically, this is a movie pushes that classic primal idea of good vs evil, but also how unity and diversity is what will give the upper hand. I found moments that were ""cheesy"" but were in such strong moments that I was emotionally engaged and touched instead of feeling manipulated. Very excellent choreography and fight scenes, the attention to costumes and surroundings were splendid, cgi and fx was well made and didn't take up too much space, and the actors were convincing."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"This is a movie where I think you would benefit from keeping in mind the cultural and historical context in which this movie was made while watching, it's not only a movie. I like that the ""cheese"" was made in a way that none loose face and builds a respect and strikes the cord of the moral message it tries to convey. That in itself, gives me hope for a good and bright future between china and the west, if I may be so bold as to bring politics into this."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"The story is kept at a good pace and never really drags on so as to become boring, there is constant development and as the story progressed to my surprise I actually cared for the main characters."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"If all you want is a ""jackie chan"" fight+comedy then you may not like this as it's more ""serious"", but if you don't mind a bit of cheese once in a while and keep an open heart then grab a cold beer and this might strike a cord also in you."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Oh, and the soundtrack is really epic :)"
Tian jiang xiong shi,"I thought my first review might be for something awesome, but I cant help myself, I have to discuss this film. I question mainly why I watched it to the end. Firstly - the positives - some good action, some realistic looking fights, deaths, blood, arrows etc. and two minor laughs where I believe we were meant to laugh. Now the negatives - I spent far too long laughing or groaning at the rest of the film. It really should be a lesson to school kids writing stories/scripts - don't overdo it. You don't need to. Too many flashbacks to help tell the back story. Too much slow motion for dramatic effect Too much dramatic music for dramatic effect Too many flashbacks to remind us why/how we should feel. Too many big metaphors, statements and themes - most of which were also poorly delivered by otherwise quality actors. Too many big dramatic moments that should be reserved for the end of the film. And then the weird very beginning and very end that don't fit well with the story - are we meant to believe this is a true story or what? If you took out the flashbacks and slow motion the whole story could have been told in an hour. You could have got rid of the beginning and ending and replaced with a simple statement to set the time and place."
Tian jiang xiong shi,And if that wasn't enough - Jackie Chan singing? Twice?
Tian jiang xiong shi,##Storyline##
Tian jiang xiong shi,**Coherence (10): Every scene and element in the movie is tightly correlated. It shows a solid story from beginning to end. It just seem fluent and natural.
Tian jiang xiong shi,"**Reasoning (9): Everything actually make sense, except for the language part. Surprisingly, the movie is not consistent about the usage of language. The Chinese use Chinese language. But the Romans use English? The Arabs use Chinese? Come on! And also some of the scene somehow forgot to display the immense people involved or that existed in the area. Where's the 800 Roman soldier that build the building? About the war scene, it's actually NEAR-PERFECT. It just lack the display of how the Roman Counsel or Generals manage their 100,000 strong soldiers in the battlefield. I mean, in the beginning, there's 100,000 soldiers. But during the battle, somehow it's only half of that. In short, for the other parts of the movie, it's just NEAR-PERFECT."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"**Predictability (8): Actually it's quite refreshing that it's not really predictable. In most Hollywood movies, you'll notice that everything is just predictable. There's a handsome guy who meets a pretty girl, then they both fall in love, then they both have sex. And the good guy always win disregarding the odds. But in Dragon Blade, thank God it's not like that!! Not all good guy win. And this movie does not exaggerate the Chinese even though it's a Chinese production. It shows a balance strength and weakness in every culture. This is PLUS POINT."
Tian jiang xiong shi,##Characters##
Tian jiang xiong shi,"**Personality (9): The characters are alive! Despite what other critics say about this movie, see it for yourself. It's a serious movie and the main characters really does show their own personality. It's comparable to ""Dark Knight"" and ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes""."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"**Conversation (9): Fluent and natural according to their personality. Again, it's a prove that this movie is better than most Hollywood movies."
Tian jiang xiong shi,##Special Effects##
Tian jiang xiong shi,**Visual Effect (10): Stunning!! Realistic environment! Massive display of people working together. Fantastic war scene where the Romans battle against multiple nations. All fighting scenes are realistic! Not like Hollywood movies which show soldiers die easily even though they wore heavy steel armor. Hollywood movies are lame in that respect.
Tian jiang xiong shi,**Audio Effect (10): Inspiring!! Captivating!! Makes you want to cry once in a while.
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Read a review claiming Dragon Blade achieved ""so bad it's good"" status. Wow, did it ever! Imagine if Sharknado (the dethroned champion of ""so bad it's good) had a $65 million budget."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"This movie had a lot of good going for it. Jackie Chan is an amazing action star, made famous by his ""stunt fighting"" which he excels at in this movie. The production value was really top notch - sets, costumes, cinematography, special effects, all of it was quite impressive."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Where this movie fails on every level is the writing and the acting. I could go into great detail but I think the best comparison is the cheesy, campy entertainment that is the SyFy original movie."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Adrien Brody and John Cusack must have signed onto this movie like all the A-list celebrities back in the 80s making Japanese commercials for a quick buck, certain that no one in America would ever see them."
Tian jiang xiong shi,"Open-minded I started to watch this film and I did manage to watch until the end. And that says a lot. The whole movie is chaotic and makes you wonder if this was meant as a comedy or some kind of parody of the heroic tale. And that side-stepping and wondering destroys the experience of the movie. If not for the decent/OK action scenes and camera work, I would rate this movie a 1. Very disappointing, almost infantile. If the movie was indeed intended as a serious tale from history I would be even offended. Over the top clichés and chewed out plots of thirteen in a dozen, just dreadful. Too bad, I really like Jackie Chan movies, but more as an actor then producer."
Testament of Youth,"I remember being given this book as a set text for an English A-Level examination over 30 years ago and am aware that there was a prestigious BBC production of it also several years back but this is the first dramatisation I've seen of Vera Brittain's novel documenting her own experiences in that golden age of post-Edwardian pre WW1 England when for coming-of-age birthdays you got given a piano from your father. That's if you were a girl of course, her more musically gifted brother conversely gets what she would have wanted, a scholarship at Oxford although on the other hand he is also at the the prime age to be called up for what he and most everyone else (but not their knowing father) believes will be a short, heroic and clean war which of course it turned out not to be (apart from the heroic part)."
Testament of Youth,"Young Vera is headstrong, not only about wanting to make her own way in a man's world (female emancipation was still years away), but later about making her own contribution to the war effort by enrolling as a nurse while her lover, brother and other male friends are fighting in the trenches. Told wholly from her point of view, it's an entertaining if not enthralling watch, beautifully shot and well acted if somehow just lacking some extra pathos to really capture the hellish undertow of the War to end all Wars."
Testament of Youth,"Alicia Vikander is appealing as the vaguely tomboyish, intellectual Vera. In those days, it would appear, the golden youth had to be chaperoned everywhere by a usually imposing maiden aunt figure and make their feelings about each other known by writing and sending poems as the film strives to contrast the idyllic pre-war days of carefree swimming and carousing with the bleakness and destruction of war itself. For me, I didn't feel the contrast quite sharply enough and my abiding memories of the film are of the big family house and the dreaming spires of Oxford rather than the hell of the makeshift military hospitals and muddy and bloody trenches on the front line."
Testament of Youth,"The best shot for me was when I perhaps detected a tribute to all-time great movie ""Gone With The Wind"" as Vera goes Scarlett-like amongst the wounded and dying, searching for her wounded brother where the camera ascends into a sweeping dolly shot showing the full extent of the number of the casualties, just like Vincent Fleming's rightly famous take all those years ago."
Testament of Youth,"The supporting actors are picked from the familiar directory of experienced British character actors, notably Miranda Richardson and Emily Watson, while the young actors in the leads, all of them unfamiliar to me, perform with aplomb."
Testament of Youth,"There is a great true-life story to be told here and this film does so respectfully and responsibly, if just a little too carefully at times."
Testament of Youth,Based on the memoir by Vera Brittain (Alicia Vikander 'A Royal Affair' – who is superb) this is one woman's story of her war. We go back to 1914 before that awful war had begun and find a young and feisty woman (referred to at the time as a 'blue stocking') who has ambitions of studying at Oxford and is willing to shun the conventions of finding a husband din order to realise her dream.
Testament of Youth,"She has a brother Edward (played touchingly by Taron Egerton) and he introduces her to his friend Roland. After a shaky start they realise they share a passion for poetry, the romantic sort and a friendship blossoms as indeed do their feelings. Then the war comes and everyone's intended plans for the future are put on hold to do their duty."
Testament of Youth,"What follows is truly heartbreaking, I was moved to tears at one point and that is very rare. The cinematography is superb, the direction excellent and all of the actors are completely convincing and bring their respective roles to full realised life. One of the poems starts with the words 'life and hope and love and you', and that could be a pretty good description of what this film is about. The whole thing is just excellent and is a film that I can not only thoroughly recommend but would urge people to see."
Testament of Youth,"This magical film focuses on the diaries of the noted writer Vera Brittain. Vera battles against all objections to win a post at Oxford university, studying English literature at Somerville Cottage. War breaks out, and all those close around her sign up to fight, including her love Roland, wanting to help and make a difference she turns her back on Oxford and becomes a nurse. The War had heartbreaking consequences for so many, Vera included."
Testament of Youth,"The film boasts an utterly wonderful cast, it's no wonder that there are some fabulous performances, Alicia Vikander is utterly sensational as Vera, watching this film you'd never in your dreams believe she was Swedish, her RP English is incredible. I've been a life long fan of Miranda Richardson, and she doesn't disappoint, she truly is a national treasure. Colin Morgan is excellent as Victor, one scene in particular was incredibly moving."
Testament of Youth,"The period detail is impeccable, the buildings, decor, fashions, hairstyles etc, all is as it should be, it certainly looks the part."
Testament of Youth,"The scenes in France are so sad, very distressing, but painfully real I imagine. You'd need to be made of granite not to feel something."
Testament of Youth,"There is a huge switch in tone in the film, the first 40 minutes are gentle, almost idyllic, but as War strikes there's a shift, it's almost purposely slow to begin."
Testament of Youth,"It's a fabulous film, one that totally draws you in, I found it extremely engaging. Beautifully acted, you will need your hankies, not ashamed to admit I cried. 9/10"
Testament of Youth,"Testament of Youth (2014) was directed by James Kent. It's a dramatic film based on the autobiography of the noted English pacifist, Vera Brittain."
Testament of Youth,"Alicia Vikander plays Vera Brittain, who in pre-WW I England, is barely allowed by her family to think for herself. She wants to go to Oxford and become a writer. Neither of these options is welcomed by her family. She persists, and does, indeed, get accepted at Oxford. However, all this debate and discussion about her future becomes basically irrelevant when World War I breaks out. Her brother, her fiancé, and their good friend all join the army. Vera becomes a nurse, first in England and then at the front."
Testament of Youth,"There aren't too many battle scenes. Instead--and in a way, worse--we get scenes of the carnage that follows the battles. When Vera is at the front, the scenes at the aid stations are graphic and horrible to watch."
Testament of Youth,"Another reviewer pointed out the similarity of one of the scenes to a scene in ""Gone with the Wind."" I noticed this too. In both movies, the camera pulls back to show us a huge field of wounded shoulders on stretchers, with just a few nurses moving among them trying to lessen their suffering."
Testament of Youth,"It's easy to understand why Vera Brittain was changed forever by her experiences as a nurse. So, in a technical sense, this is a coming-of-age movie. However, it's much more than that. Vera's coming of age meant that she understood the basic futility of the killing and maiming. Working with the wounded and the dying at the battlefront wasn't something that she was able to forget and put behind her. The war changed her into the peace activist that she became and remained."
Testament of Youth,"Alicia Vikander is a superb actor. This isn't her first film, but I was unaware of her work until I saw Testament of Youth. An earlier reviewer found her appearance too waif-like. In my opinion, she wasn't waif-like, but she had an astonishingly delicate Pre-Raphaelite beauty. My thought is that this works in the context of the movie. She may have looked delicate and incapable of any difficult, terrible work, but, when the time came, she rose to the challenge."
Testament of Youth,"We saw this film at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. It will work better on the large screen, because of the gorgeous scenery we see in England. (Obviously, there wasn't much beauty left in the scenery of war-torn France or Belgium.) Still, this is a film worth seeking out. If it's no longer playing in theaters, see it on the small screen. It's an challenging, important movie. Don't miss it."
Testament of Youth,'Testament Of Youth' is a BBC film.
Testament of Youth,"The film opens with a maffick, but with one young woman being rather subdued, even dazed. Then in a clever scene, there is a Col. Blimp- style swimming scene."
Testament of Youth,"We are introduced to Vera Brittain, living in provincial comfort in Buxton Derbyshire, and struggling against social convention. She and her young male friends, all on the threshold of adulthood, are looking to the future. It is the summer of 1914 and the era is caught well and authentically."
Testament of Youth,"Love is in the air and as our story develops we get some nice Michael Corleone-style 'Sicilian' courting. In a small part, Joanne Scanlan plays the chaperon Aunt Belle. She delivers to the part the same depth that she did when playing Mrs Catherine Dickens in last year's 'The Invisible Woman'. Played initially for laughs, the chaperon takes a much deeper and more human role as Summer moves into Autumn. There is a station scene, much more dramatic than that in the recent 'The Imitation Game', because the trains are going in a different direction."
Testament of Youth,"Vera Brittain herself wrote of critics who doubted the authenticity of her account. Who are we, to measure the authenticity and depth of feeling of young lovers? This was their love, not ours! The reality of WWI, of course, can be easily measured and recounted."
Testament of Youth,"The film gets progressively darker as the war intrudes into the story. The darkest scenes of all are set in France. These scenes are grim and gritty, muddy and bloody. There are many poignant scenes of love and war. Vera Brittain's male companions are played well by a strong cast. The central character of Roland Leighton is well played by Kit Harington, Here however, his romantic side is much more subdued, than that in his role in last year's 'Pompeii', where he featured in what was arguably the most romantic kiss scene of all time. Appropriately, Colin Morgan who has previously played the role of Merlin, here adds some magic, in what is perhaps the most poignant scene in this film. Perhaps the most sinister-looking figure in the film, is the innocent-faced-looking telegram-boy, played by Xavier Atkins. A small but scary part."
Testament of Youth,"Pre-war Imperial Britain changed to the post-war era of Vera Brittain. The pre-war campaign for votes for women failed. The war forced women to do jobs previously done by men, to take up new roles and new responsibilities. Thus the post-war clamour for women's equality could no longer be ignored, and instead change started. The life and literature of Vera Brittain was an inspiration for the next generation, not the least being her daughter, the politician Shirley Williams. Vera Brittain's 'Testament' is now a recognized part of British culture and history. It is a long time since I read her book, but it seems to me that this film authentically captures the story in the book."
Testament of Youth,"WWI was a seminal event. It changed the lives of a generation. it was a dominant theme in thinking in the inter-war period. To understand positions taken before and during WWII, we need to understand the context in which these positions were adopted."
Testament of Youth,In four short years British history was changed forever. So too for the world. This true story authentically captures the period and the resultant changes. 9/10.
Testament of Youth,"It's not an overly similar movie, but as I've recently watched Atonement, Testament of Youth gave me that same sort of touchingly effective drama with a backdrop of a world war. Obviously, the two are very differently told films. But they proved to each impress in a similar way. For Testament of Youth, this was Alicia Vikander and Kit Harrington's coming out party, at least in the film world. The latter is famous for his turn in that one certain HBO show while Vikander hadn't really done anything of notoriety before this, and she is absolutely the best part about this film. Whether it be as the tomb raiding Lara Croft, the grieving Isabel Graysmark, or the curious Ava, she is brilliant in anything she does. In fact, she's quickly becoming one of my favorite actresses to watch, merely for the sheer charisma she brings with every role. And as much as I want to commend Harrington, Taron Egerton, Dominic West (who ironically also plays her father in Tomb Raider), Colin Morgan, Hayley Atwell, and Emily Watson, no one comes close to Vikander's performance here. If this film didn't get lost in her year of Danish Girl & Ex Machina, perhaps she could have been an awards contender for this film. In fact, this may be my favorite performance of hers. Can I be anymore genuine about her utterly genuine turn?"
Testament of Youth,9.0/10
Testament of Youth,"I first read ""Testament of Youth"" during university and was captivated by the emotionally moving real-life story of love and loss during war. The memoir spurred me on to read more about Vera Brittain, particularly during the World War I period that is the setting of ""Testament of Youth."" Having read her diary ""Chronicle of Youth"" and ""Letters from a Lost Generation"" long before watching this film, I had formed a strong attachment to Vera Brittain almost as if she was a personal friend. Reading her words, it is very easy for anyone, particularly a young, studious person to relate to her and the blossoming romance she describes between herself and her first love, Roland Leighton."
Testament of Youth,"As such, I had extremely high expectations for this film, and was skeptical that Alicia Vikander and Kit Harington would be ""my"" Vera and Roland--I had such a fixed idea of them in my head. Fortunately Alicia and Kit's performances met my expectations. They had wonderful chemistry and the relationship as portrayed captured the essence of Vera and Roland: the intelligent, witty banter, sweet/innocent flirtatiousness, passion and angst. This relationship is at the heart of the memoir and is the driving force for much of what occurs during and after its commencement, so it was very important for this relationship to be portrayed accurately and to be emotionally moving for the audience, which it certainly was for me."
Testament of Youth,"Supporting characters played by Taron Egerton (Edward) and Colin Morgan (Victor) were also wonderfully portrayed, which was a relief as the relationships with her brother and friend are extremely important in the memoir as well, and just as emotionally moving as the romance between Vera and Roland. As far as the other aspects of the film are concerned, the stirring scenes at the hospital where Vera volunteers as a nurse are gripping and faithfully portray the tumultuous wartime experiences that Vera describes in her memoir."
Testament of Youth,"The highlight for me was the poetry of Roland which is interwoven during key moments in the film. This is a lovely element to the story that I found very touching and it provides a beautiful, emotional backdrop for key scenes."
Testament of Youth,"I really hope this film spurs those who haven't read the memoir/have never heard of Vera Brittain to go on and read ""Testament of Youth."" The book certainly lingered in my mind for quite some time after I had first read it, and the film likewise recaptured those feelings for me."
Testament of Youth,"23 January 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Testament of Youth. Based on the book by Vera Brittain which is a best selling account of her experiences during the First World War, this film follows the life of Vera herself during those harrowing times. Starting out gently, we follow Vera, her brother and his friends from their comfortable life in the country to the eve of the war in 1914 and beyond. I say gently because this film eases you into what was one of the horrors of recent history, a time which shattered people and ruined lives forever. After fighting so hard to get to Oxford, Vera then gives it all up to become a nurse, a journey which ultimately takes her to France and gives her first hand experience of the massacre that war dishes out. There is a romantic thread running through the film but her strongest bond is with her brother and her world is torn apart when he signs up to fight. Vera was played beautifully by Alicia Vikander, a Swedish actress who I am not familiar with, but she had look of Emily Blunt in her facial expressions and mannerisms, and unfortunately did not seem to age at all during the film, not even in grief. However that is my only criticism in an elegantly shot film even when covering the abomination that is war. Another cinematic experience to make you think."
Testament of Youth,"Considered one of the greatest war memoirs ever written, the Testament of Youth is a true-life account of Vera Brittian's life from 1914 - 1918, and a chronicle of how the First World War affected not only her, but the nation's lives."
Testament of Youth,"One of the things that determines Testament of Youth different to other bloody, explosive and bullet-ridden war tales is that it is focused on the domestic view of the ones who not only joined the war on the front-line, but also those at home and the consequent effects on loved ones, offering an unseen perspective, and solid-account of the despair that war causes."
Testament of Youth,"Beginning in pre-war 1914, we are introduced to Vera Brittain, a determined and wilful individual with aspirations of not becoming just a traditional young-married women, but one who attends Oxford University and chooses her own life-choices."
Testament of Youth,"Along with her brother Edward (Taron Egerton) and his two friends Victor (Colin Morgan) and Geoffrey (Jonathan Bailey), they all enjoy their youth in the rural village with their parents (Dominic West and Emily Fox). On-the-road to Oxford, she is introduced to her brothers close friend Roland (Kit Harington), and a relationship soon breaks out - but untimely, as does the war."
Testament of Youth,"Quite proud to do so out of loyalty to Queen and country, her brother Edward, and friends Victor and Geoffrey with Roland all sign up to the forces to assist. (Against parental wishes to do so). Now at Oxford, yet unable to focus as this devastation is happening all around her, she joins the forces too, as a nurse - and the film develops from there."
Testament of Youth,"Given a world-premiere at the 58th BFI London Film Festival, the film is squeezed out in time for the Remembrance holidays and by-all accounts award season. Based on our criticism alone, it is going to be praised and remembered at both."
Testament of Youth,"Crafted by former TV-movie director, James Kent, along with the (brilliant) cast, Testament of Youth is a thoroughly engaging history drama in Downton Abbey-esqe war times and a unique approach to the war like never before."
Testament of Youth,"The centenary of the outbreak of what was at the time called The Great War, and came later to be known as The First World War, led to an outpouring of commemorative and cultural events. This explains the timing of ""Testament Of Youth"" which in fact is based on the famous first instalment of the memoirs of Vera Brittain (1893-1970) which was published as long ago as 1933 and is still in print. It is both a tale of tragic loss as young, idealistic men volunteer for the slaughter fields of France and Belgium and an account of an intelligent young woman's efforts to obtain a university education and make her independent way in the world."
Testament of Youth,"There is a fine ensemble cast of established and new British actors, but the central role is the subject of a surprise and bold piece of casting as the Swedish actress Alicia Vikander plays the quintessentially British Brittain. However, Vikander gives a luminous performance and she is clearly destined for a very successful career. There is a sense of authenticity in having a female scriptwriter Juliette Towhidi to turn Brittain's memoir into a film and the whole thing is beautifully shot with stunning scenery plus period dress and transport."
Testament of Youth,"There is a scene in ""Testament Of Youth"" which borrows directly from an iconic shot in the classic movie ""Gone With The Wind"": in both works, an overhead camera pulls back as the central female character walks through a field of dead and dying men revealing ever-larger numbers of bodies."
Testament of Youth,"I found that this movie was very sad because just like World War 2, loved ones were lost, overcrowding hospitals, soldiers,etc. Alicia Vikander was absolutely excellent at playing the role as the writer Vera Brittain. I seriously didn't know that Vera Brittain was a real person until before the credits that she was an actual help nurse during World War I. It really makes you think, what was it like back then? I'm sure it was pretty rough looking after all the injured and the dying soldiers at the same time. It probably was pretty exhausting for running around looking after everyone!"
Testament of Youth,"It's heartbreaking that her fiancée, her brother, her brothers friend and many others she knew who fought in the war. I swear, even thought the actor's are not the actual people, it still breaks your heart."
Testament of Youth,"If you haven't cried while watching this, something is wrong here. It's just so sad, that's all I can say😢😢😢😢💔💔💔💔 💔💔💔"
Testament of Youth,"Vera Brittain's ""Testament of Youth"", an autobiographical memoir of her service as a nurse in the First World War, was controversial when it first appeared in 1933, largely because it was written from a pacifist viewpoint and rejected the official British position that we had been fighting a ""just war"" against German aggression. It was, however, also extremely popular and has never been out of print since. What gave it its popularity was Brittain's ability to describe both the horrors she had witnessed and her own personal sense of loss. Her fiancé Roland Leighton, her brother Edward and two close friends, Victor Richardson and Geoffrey Thurlow, were all killed in battle. The story was turned into a memorable television series, with Cheryl Campbell in the leading role, in the early eighties, and now has become a film, doubtless because of the interest in the war sparked by last year's centenary celebrations."
Testament of Youth,"The film opens in 1914, just before the outbreak of war. Vera is a young woman from a well-to-do family who is hoping to study at Oxford University, despite the opposition of her father. Like many men of the period, he believes firmly that women's place is in the home as a wife and mother and that no man will want to marry a ""bluestocking"", as he dismissively calls female intellectuals. Eventually, however, he relents and allows Vera to sit the entrance examination. By the time she arrives in Oxford, however, war has broken out and Vera, who initially reacts with patriotic enthusiasm, believes that she needs to do something to aid the war effort. Postponing her studies, she volunteers to serve as an army nurse."
Testament of Youth,"What she sees on the battlefields of France shakes her conviction that the war is some grand heroic enterprise. There is a suggestion that her conversion to pacifism may partly have been motivated by guilt. Although her father may have been ultra-conservative in other respects, he was opposed to the war, which he correctly foresaw would be long and bloody, and tried to dissuade Edward from volunteering, only relenting as a result of Vera's entreaties. When Edward was subsequently killed, Vera felt herself to have been partly responsible."
Testament of Youth,"Compared to the TV serial, which was broadcast in several episodes, the film of necessity has to condense or omit much of the material from the original book. There is, for example, no mention of the period Vera spent working in Malta. Some parts of her story were rewritten for the sake of dramatic licence; contrary to what is shown here, for example, she did not meet her future husband George Catlin until after the war. Nor did she receive news of Roland's death on what was to have been their wedding day. Some rewriting, however, is normally inevitable whenever a book, particularly one as long as ""Testament of Youth"", is adapted for the cinema. (Those who adapt books for television, with more time at their disposal, can afford to be more faithful)."
Testament of Youth,"The film-makers were fortunate to have an actress as gifted as the lovely Alicia Vikander in the main role, bringing out Vera's compassion as well as her determination. Congratulations are also due to Alicia on her perfect English accent. While watching the film, in fact, I never suspected that she was not British by birth. It was only later that I discovered she is actually Swedish."
Testament of Youth,"The story of the trenches of the First World War has become a familiar one over the last hundred years, immortalised not only in history books but also in countless memoirs, novels, poems, paintings, films and television programmes. Most of those, however, were told from a male viewpoint, normally the viewpoint of the men who actually did the fighting. A film like this one is valuable because it gives us a woman's point of view. 8/10"
Testament of Youth,"Having read some of the negative remarks regarding the film makers' decision to not show extensive scenes from the mucky trenches, I must respectfully disagree. From War Horse to the Wipers Times, there have been quite a few films over the last few years that covered the horrifying reality of life in the trenches of Europe."
Testament of Youth,"I found this to be a well-acted and balanced presentation. It has left me with a lingering sadness and I feel that it has accomplished the purpose of showing the viewers the aching emptiness and futility of war. No one in this story escaped the impact of the World War I years. Although most of the focus is on Vera, we do see the anguish of the others who surround her throughout those years."
Testament of Youth,"Previously unfamiliar with the back-story of this writer, I was very satisfied with the film portrayal of her life."
Testament of Youth,"I watched the TV adaptation of Testament of Youth many, many years ago. As we were studying World War One at school, the destruction and carnage left me horrified; therefore I was deeply moved by Vera Brittan's account of fledging love and war time losses. I picked up this version of Netflix last night with great interest; could it, I wondereed, top the series that left me spellbound nearly three decades ago?"
Testament of Youth,"The answer is not quite, the BBC TV series just shades it. I think the series alllows the characters a little more development time than the film allows. Nevertheless, there are a great many merits to this film. Although some of criticism of Alicia Vikander's Vera were a little harsh - she was growing up in a restrictive Edwardian, where 'young ladies' where expected to behave in a certain way - the cast and direction are uniformly first rate. I got a vivid impression of Rupert Brooke's England - lush, pastoral, with carefree youths at one with nature; a long vanished tranquility, that perhaps never really existed, except innoir imagination."
Testament of Youth,"The scene at the railway station was nothing short of heartbreaking - it is here, with Roland's departure, that enormity of what might happen actually sinks in."
Testament of Youth,"As the war drags on Vera volunteers as a nurse, anything to be closer to her loved ones at The Front - a fiancee, a brother, two close friends. She copes amidst the horrific carnage, the grim aftermath that's far from the honour and glory. Like the women left behind in all wars since the dawn of time, through a series of hard lesson she learns to gradually cope with the responsibilities thrust upon her - whilst living in a state of near constant trepidation; anything to avoid the dreaded telegram."
Testament of Youth,"I remember her compassion towards the dying German soldier - the enemy who bleeds the same blood, has the same flesh as we do."
Testament of Youth,"Her world is shattered many time over; War, grief and illness bleed her. It is staggering to think how many families must have went through same ordeal - only to emerge with wrecked lives into a confused and dangerous new world with no clear answers."
Testament of Youth,"Vera Brittan's work is for the survivors and their ghosts, for anyone who survived a war and asks 'why?' on their lips. It is a superb film and a worthy adaption. Watch it or the TV series."
Testament of Youth,"Vikander's assured performance really saves this film from being just another solemn costume drama, and it's largely thanks to her that the passion that inspired Vera Brittain's antiwar classic still shows through despite a sometimes rushed and perfunctory screenplay. Kit Harington (""Game of Thrones"") is suitably intense as Vera's fiancé, Roland Leighton (didn't recognize John Snow at first in his new guise as beardless nature poet)."
Testament of Youth,"The camera may seem to dwell too much on idyllic country scenes and beautiful vistas at the expense of plot and character, though that does help to heighten the contrast between Vera's privileged but restricted prewar life and the new life of purpose and endless horror that awaits her at a field hospital in France. The camera's used most effectively when the two worlds collide-to illustrate Roland's poem addressed to the corpse of a German soldier found lying in a patch of wildflowers, most of all in the panorama of a boundless field of dead and dying men surrounding the hospital after a ""big push"" (which echoes the famous crane shot after the Battle of Atlanta in ""Gone with the Wind""). I'll let the nitpickers figure out if the Leightons' house on the South Coast really did have a magnificent view of what looks like the White Cliffs of Dover, but the stormy shoreline makes the perfect backdrop for a scene in which Roland returns angry and shellshocked from the front"
Testament of Youth,"The basic storyline-Vera's service in France and her romance with Roland Leighton-is skillfully dramatized and very moving; her struggle with the conventions of Georgian family life is somewhat less involving, one exception being an ironic episode in which she's summoned back from the front to deal with a family ""crisis,"" only to find that her mother's gotten sick and has fallen behind with the housework"
Testament of Youth,The much-praised '79 series with Cheryl Campbell only seems to be available on VHS and Region 2 DVD; I wouldn't hesitate in recommending this gorgeous and affecting new version as an alternative.
Testament of Youth,"With a poll taking place on IMDb's Classic Film board for the best titles of 2015,I started to look around for movies to view from the year.Being very impressed by Alicia Vikander's performances in Ex_Machina & The Danish Girl,I was delighted to discover that Netflix UK has put another of Vikander's 2015 offerings on their site,which led to me getting ready to read the testament."
Testament of Youth,The plot:
Testament of Youth,England 1914-
Testament of Youth,"Ignoring her parents remarks that she has no chance of getting in, Vera Brittain applies for a place at Oxford University. Believing she has little chance of getting in,Brittain is surprised to receive an invite from the University. Thrilled at getting in,Brittain starts a blossoming romance with Roland Leighton,whilst her brother Edward and friends Victor Richardson and Geoffrey Thurlow celebrate Brittain getting into university."
Testament of Youth,"As Brittain enters Oxford,news starts to spread that Archduke Franz Ferdinand has been assassinated.Feeling that they all must go and protect their country,Roland,Victor and Geoffrey decide to join the army.Hearing doubts from her mum and dad,Brittain gives Edward all her support in going to war. Taking a break from studying to become a nurse,Brittain soon discovers the truth behind ""The Great War."""
Testament of Youth,View on the film:
Testament of Youth,"Backed by a silk score from Max Richter,director James Kent & cinematographer Rob Hardy (who also worked on Ex_Machina) give the film a beautiful water colour appearance,with the light brushing of misty blues,yellows and browns giving the movie a faded photo atmosphere.Capturing Brittain gradually get a sense of doubt over, ""The Great War"" Kent & Hardy casts bursts of dazzling bright light across the film,which burnt out as the horrors of war hit home.Whilst blood from the injured soldiers is shown,Kent takes great care in making sure that the focus is on Brittain's reaction to the horrific number of deaths,as stylish, extreme close-ups capture the sorrow and anger running across Brittain's face."
Testament of Youth,"Based on Brittain's autobiography,the screenplay by Juliette Towhidi gives everyone in Brittain's life their moment to shine,from Victor being buried in the full horror of war,to a very touching holding of fingers revealing Roland Leighton's love for Brittain.Caught up in the middle of WWI,Towhidi superbly balances the opening buds of tragedy and sorrow which strike Brittain with a rich determined personality which builds as Brittain raises her voice against the war."
Testament of Youth,"Coming into the film as a replacement for Saoirse Ronan,the gorgeous Alicia Vikander gives an excellent performance as Brittain. Revealing the love for Roland Leighton in a quiet,tender manner,Vikander brilliantly displays a determined inner strength within Brittain by giving her body language a petite,fragile presentation which is neatly countered by Vikander's expressive face showing Brittain trying to remain strong for the fallen.Joining Vikander, Kit Harington gives the film a shot of dashing,sweet-face charm as Leighton,and Colin Morgan makes the aftershock of war hit home in his wonderful,worn down performance of Victor,as they all read from the testament of youth."
Testament of Youth,"Though fighting might not be the right word. The movie also seems to go a completely different direction at first, with the now Oscar winning actress in the front row. It remains about her and her feelings throughout, but you might think it would concentrate on another aspect of life. On the other hand, when war happens, everything else seems to not matter anymore. Even things you fought very hard for."
Testament of Youth,"Some decisions are not understandable, especially the way they are ""explained"" by the characters, but irrational thinking does hit us from time to time. The question is, if we can bounce back from mistakes (or if we're allowed to). This also shows how grim war can be and what toll it takes, especially from the young (as the song goes: ""War? What is it good for? Absolutely nothing""). Powerful performances make this a drama that is worth a watch"
Testament of Youth,"TESTAMENT OF YOUTH is the latest filmed version of the memoirs of Vera Brittain, who charts her life story during the First World War. It's a tale of romance and foreboding, of warfare and peace, of healing and nursing, all tied up in a searching narrative. From the trailers I was expecting this to be heavy on trench scenes, but the war material is quite scarce and usually kept off-screen; the focus very much is on Brittain herself. The film has the visual quality and measured pacing of a typical BBC drama adaptation, and there's no faulting the attention to detail. I did like the way that it doesn't shy away from the darker psychological aspects of the story. The supporting cast is fine, and Alicia Vikander is okay as the protagonist, but not entirely sympathetic; you never feel like there's much going on inside her head."
Testament of Youth,"Have noticed others have said they were a little upset with a couple of added sequences that were not from the book. Having not read the book this offered no distraction. While it maybe agreeable when a movie adaption follows a book - they remain distinctly different mediums - two different styles of writing, so it's not always fair to compere them. The book in this case is Vera Brittain's autobiography. This strong story has remained in print since it's first publishing in the early 1930's - quite something for a female writer of this era."
Testament of Youth,"Since the release of that fine Turkish film ""Gallipoli"" in 2005, 'Testament Of Youth' has to be one of the best examinations of the unforgivably tragic wastage of WWI - This was war created at the whims of those who regarded themselves as the upper echelons - so called leaders who did not deserve the very breath in their bodies. This BBC Films 2014/15 production is stunning to look at and listen too, from Jon Henson's detailed production design to just about every last cast member it's a powerful thought provoker. Swedish born Alicia Vikander may not always seem the right choice for the lead but works very hard in a demanding role, Kit Harington convinces as Roland, Alexandra Roach as Winifred, Dominic West as Dad and Emily Watson as Mum, fine performances all...."
Testament of Youth,"It's a strong feature directorial debut for James Kent - embellished with mostly lavish visual support provided by D.O.P. Rob Hardy (and thank heavens hand held camera-work is kept to a minimum). The screenplay by Juliette Towhidi is kept in check by the real life daughter of Vera Brittain, Shirley Williams. It's possibly because of this careful control the whole production maintains a high level of integrity that's rarely seen in modern movies. Lavish scenes involving steam trains are lovingly set up using trains from the Keighley and Worth / North Yorkshire Moors Railways. The music score by Max Richter (The Lunchbox '13 & Re-composing Vivaldi '14) adds handsomely and has been blessed with full-scale orchestrations by Dave Foster."
Testament of Youth,"What's unique about this film's treatment is its solid focus on being told from a female perspective. A young woman who experienced first hand the loss of family, lover, and friends - who then went on to write and speak out about the dehumanizing impact on all those who served and died or were left to suffer throughout their lives. And for what 'essential' purpose?. This film brings home the horror - not with endless shots of hideous trench warfare but by taking us into the inadequate treatment 'hospitals', where so many young lives agonizingly wasted away. All very tragic, but needs to be told and re-told..."
Testament of Youth,"Vera Brittain (Alicia Vikander) wants to go to Oxford but her parents (Dominic West, Emily Watson) wants her to look for a husband. Her brother Edward (Taron Egerton), and friends Victor Richardson (Colin Morgan) and Roland Leighton (Kit Harington) all adore her. Vera falls for Roland and gets accepted to Somerville College, Oxford. As WWI approaches, her guys all volunteer. She convinces her father to let Edward enlist. She defers college and volunteers to be a nurse."
Testament of Youth,It has a slow period-piece start. It's got a nice hazy moody feel. Vikander is great but the guys need more exposition. They don't have enough space to show their characters. It's a slow burn and it's all concentrated on Vikander. She wins me over slowly. She has great sadness. It has very poignant moments especially in the later parts.
Testament of Youth,"Told from the rarely seen or heard from perspective of a female in the times of war, U.K author Vera Brittain's memoir Testament of Youth first published in 1933, has in the succeeding years become one of literature's most renowned memoirs and arguably the quintessential voice to the youth that found themselves in the midst of the world's first all-encompassing war. Such a renowned piece of history, so loved and well known by many, is a daunting prospect to adapt but first time feature film director James Kent has crafted an elegant and quietly devastating project that's acts as a touching tribute to Brittan's memory and her touching writings."
Testament of Youth,"Filmed at a languid pace, now mostly foreign in modern day period adaptations, Kent and cinematographer Rob Hardy have crafted an artistic vision of Youth, perfectly encapsulating the wonders of walking a college ground, life on an old English manor or the sadness of a make shift medical ground that harbors the aftermath of life on the front line in World War 1. It's a beautifully filmed movie, every scene could be a painting and despite Youth's obvious budget constraints, there's never a moment here that makes one feel as though they're watching a film that is anything but high class. It's a credit to Kent, Hardy and also screenwriter Juliette Towhidi that they manage such a loaded and intelligent tale in the way they do and with a young, talented cast, Youth shines a light on some growing acting up and comers that will one day likely be members of the A-list."
Testament of Youth,"I for one have not been quiet in my growing praise for young Swedish actress Alicia Vikander, and on the strength shown here by her as a leading lady, there is now another reason to suggest Vikander is likely to become one of our generation's greatest big screen talents. Imbuing Vera with a grace, vulnerability and a stern determination (much like the real life author), Vikander makes Vera her own, so much so it's hard to imagine anyone else taking on the role. Everyone's favourite GOT hero Jon Snow (Kit Harrington in real life) shows up here as Vera's first love Roland and while he shows glimmers, Harrington feels a little miscast here although against Vikander on such form, many would pale in comparison. Another impressive member of the cast is young actor Taron Egerton last seen as the Kingsman: Secret Service lead as Vera's brother Edward and after the strength shown by him in Kingsman, it's nice to see him back up that performance here."
Testament of Youth,"A harrowing – without ever being manipulative look at the horrors of war, Testament of Youth is a considered and thoughtful examination of Vera Brittain's revered words and while the film does fail in certain instances (pacing sometimes an issue, fluidity also) the film is a handsomely crafted drama with some fantastic lead turns that will likely make it a new favourite to all those that prefer their BBC over the E Network or HBO."
Testament of Youth,4 unwanted pianos out of 5
Testament of Youth,"Alicia Vikander is in pretty much every scene of this film. She does well, as do most of the other actors. It's not their fault that this adaptation of a British classic book about the First World War is mess."
Testament of Youth,"The screenplay scampers through the years, so most of the dialogue ends up being clunkily expository. When relationships or landscapes are dwelt upon, the tone is either hyper-romantic (swirling music from Max Richter) or hyper-subjective (DOP Rob Hardy and his hand-held camera). Relationships are diminished, events are melodramatised, the performances are undermined. What should be moving ends up as mawkish. A travesty."
Testament of Youth,"Track down the BBC serialisation from 1979, with the wonderful Cheryl Campbell as Vera Brittain, to see how much better this could have been done."
Testament of Youth,"Nicely photographed film but unsatisfying drama, clinically depicting the effect 'the great war' has on an annoying young student. Tragedy after tragedy plays out and this almost saintly martyr leaps from one anguished scene to another crying, sulking or shouting at people."
Testament of Youth,"Alicia Vikander, while lovely to look at, elicits no sympathy from the audience. The character she plays bears no resemblance at all to the complicated and intelligent woman from the book."
Testament of Youth,"The movie is delivered in such a contrived and melodramatic way that it feels like the director is sitting next to you with a box of tissues! There is no discernible chemistry of love or hate between any of the players and you get the feeling they showed up a few minutes before each scene was shot, handed their lines and then marched into action with a view of making it to the catering coach before the good sandwiches had been taken."
Testament of Youth,"It was just dull, boring and predictable."
Testament of Youth,"I desperately wanted to see this film, since I love all the actors and find Vera Brittain's story so incredible and heartfelt, regardless of the fact that it would have been similar to many stories after the war."
Testament of Youth,"This really is a story about love, friendship and loss."
Testament of Youth,"The fact that it was based on someone's memoir made it all that more real and devastating, considering that could happen to anyone( if a new war was to begin) and has and is, in certain parts of the world, happening to someone right now."
Testament of Youth,"They haven't sugar coated anything in this film, and even though I've gone from being cheerful to completely distraught, I wouldn't change anything about it."
Testament of Youth,"If you want to watch a film that is real, explicit in the right way, but without gore or an irrational amount of romance, and with the perfect cast and acting, that has beautifully reflected this brave woman's story...................... Look no further!"
Testament of Youth,"This is a beautiful film on many levels. The main protagonist is very sensitively played by Alicia Vikander and I found her performance totally convincing as a young Vera Brittain. We are immediately drawn in to another world that has long gone - Britain of 100 years ago....however, what has changed in terms of fruitless war and lost lives? We have learnt nothing and that is the tragedy of the message of this film. I found the costumes, the sets , the atmosphere of the film 100% engaging and accurate. The idea that Vera Brittain was born in to privilege and was one of the first women to be accepted at Oxford University is already a testament to her character and courage and determination. What follows are the harrowing stories of how those dear to her are effected by the banality and evil of war. Testament of Youth is about lost youth and how war achieves nothing at all. Hundreds of thousands of brilliant young people were lost in the two great wars, not to forget the countless wars of history. We are still in the midst of war even in the 21st century - thanks to politics and greed and madness of humanity. The film and the performances are very striking and reach one's heart. I think it is original to see a film that focuses on the experience of a woman at war. Society is largely frivolous - it takes patience and respect to sit through this and learn."
Danny Collins,"Inspired by the true story of folk singer Steve Tilston, 'Danny Collins' is A Beautiful Film, that offers great emotional depth! And Al Pacino shines in the title role, proving once again that he's among the greatest we've ever had!"
Danny Collins,'Danny Collins' Synopsis: An aging rock star decides to change his life when he discovers a 40-year-old letter written to him by John Lennon.
Danny Collins,"'Danny Collins' is at heart, a sensitive father & son story, that's emotionally charged. I was moved & overwhelmed by Danny Collins's journey, not only with his son, but also with his friends, his profession & himself. Its a fascinating character, that's been bought to life, with dexterity."
Danny Collins,"Dan Fogelman's Screenplay is top-class. Its emotional & also humorous. Fogelman's Direction, on the other-hand, is simple, yet effective. Cinematography is good. Editing is consistently crisp. Costume Design is fine. Music by Ryan Adams & Theodore Shapiro is wonderful."
Danny Collins,"Performance-Wise: Pacino is extraordinary as Danny Collins. He sinks his teeth into the part & brings it out with flying colors. Annette Bening is sweet. Bobby Cannavale is in fine form, as well. Jennifer Garner is subdued, while The Great Christopher Plummer is impeccable in his brief bit."
Danny Collins,"On the whole, 'Danny Collins' is a winner all the way! Among the best films from 2015 yet!"
Danny Collins,"I was in two minds as to whether I'd even bother with another Pacino film. He's been involved in a quite a few mediocre movies recently and I'd made a mental note to try and avoid them. However, I found plot summary of this movie quite intriguing and thought I'd give it a go. Incredibly this is one of his best films and I really enjoyed it from the start to the credits. Danny Collins has lived a hedonistic, excessive lifestyle for decades, but a surprising event causes him to look at his life and he makes substantial efforts to change and even to mend relationships. His quest may not be easy or faultless but it is still very satisfying. I cannot recommend this highly enough."
Danny Collins,"""Danny Collins"" is the kind of film ripe for emotional manipulation and mawkishness, so much so that its potential to squander its wealth of talent makes one clench in their seat, hoping for a different result than the one they foresee. While there is definitely sentimentality to be found in the film, such scenes are handled with pleasant restraint from writer/director Dan Fogelman (writer of ""Tangled"" and both ""Cars"" films). ""Danny Collins"" is likely one of the few commendable adult dramas we will get this year, and it's nice to see that it's a particularly winning blend of restriction and talent."
Danny Collins,"The film concerns the title character (played by Al Pacino in his best, most subtle role in years), an aging, alcoholic, cocaine-addicted singer, disillusioned with his current state of faking it through sold out performances, playing the same old tired songs (his most famous song echoes the tune of ""Sweet Caroline"") he has since he began his career in the 1970's. One day, he decides to drop everything, cancelling the remainder of his tour in order to venture out to stay indefinitely at a Hilton hotel and work on his songwriting, something he hasn't done in several decades, much to the dismay of his long suffering manager Frank Grubman (Christopher Plummer). While staying at the Hilton, Danny tries to make right with his son Tom (Bobby Cannavale), who has gone on to marry a beautiful woman (Jennifer Garner) and lead a solid life without the help of his father, whom views him as a deadbeat, as well as win the heart of the stubborn hotel manager Mary Sinclair (Annette Bening), who shoots down every dinner request he makes."
Danny Collins,"All of this angst and disillusionment arises when Danny receives a long-lost letter from John Lennon, following an interview at a magazine where Danny references Lennon as a major influence. In the letter, Lennon tells him to be true to himself and states that the money and fame don't corrupt a person, but personal choices and vices will always be the downfall of a man. With this, Danny becomes rather tumultuous and realizes he's been stuck in a dead-end, creative funk for years, unable to produce a winning record or anything of noteworthiness for years. He uses this opportunity to take a vacation and hopefully find creative inspiration and connectivity amongst those he should've been in contact with for many years."
Danny Collins,"Pacino is always the centerpiece of ""Danny Collins,"" in nearly every shot of the film and always bearing some kind of discernible energy, whether it be boisterous or subtle. This is Pacino's most accomplished role in years, as he finds ways to create his own character and infuse him with just the right amount of life for the occasion. He is never overcome with theatrics, and plays everything in a genuine, low-key manner, something we haven't seen from Pacino in quite some time. His portrait of an aging alcoholic musician who realizes he hasn't done anything creative or for himself in years (perhaps there's some loose, real-life connection there, but that's all speculation, of course) isn't played in a manner where overacting prevails emotion and that's the key to a great deal of ""Danny Collins""' success."
Danny Collins,"The supporting characters in ""Danny Collins"" all transcend the lines of typical supporting characters, as they branch out to become their own character and are brought to life thanks to a collection of great talent. Among the best of the lot is Christopher Plummer, who serves as Danny's best friend in the film as well as his financial and managerial guide. Plummer is just as wry here as he's ever been, never missing a comedic or dramatic beat, and turns up just in time to save the film from becoming too sappy or too dramatic. Bobby Cannavale also does arguably some of his finest work as Danny's understandably livid son, who has been left in the dark and in the working class region of the world while his father adores all the fame of show business, so he thinks, and leaves all other responsibilities unattended. Cannavale, like Pacino, acts within his own restraints of showing anger but not being overly dramatic about the entire affair, never breaking out in a fight with his father nor letting loose a monologue of vulgarities. Almost every conversation held between them conducts itself with a pleasant sense of situational realism."
Danny Collins,"""Danny Collins"" is a surprising little film, and given how its small theatrical release is being expanded little by little, I have a feeling it will resonate with the baby boomer crowd as time goes on, giving them a little opportunity for cinematic enrichment as they're often forgotten. If that's the case, this is fine film to see, especially if you're only planning on seeing one, maybe two, films this year."
Danny Collins,"This is one of those films when the title tells you nothing so, unless you see a trailer or have a recommendation, you could miss out on a real pleasure. It must have been tempting to use a title like ""How A Lost Letter From John Lennon Enabled Danny Collins to Find Himself"" but perhaps that would have said too much. Certainly the storyline is very loosely inspired by the true incident of English folk singer Steve Tilston's discovery that Lennon had written to him in 1971."
Danny Collins,"On the other hand, maybe knowing that the lead role is taken by Al Pacino would be enough for some people to view the movie, since this is an actor who consistently gives brilliant performances. Except that the character of Danny is much tenderer than most of Pacino's roles (think ""The Godfather"" movies all the way to ""Righteous Kill"") and the portrayal is much less histrionic than many of his earlier roles (think ""Scarface"" or ""The Devil's Advocate""). Blow me, Pacino even sings in this film."
Danny Collins,"One of the many delights of ""Danny Collins"" though is that Pacino (now in his mid 70s) is not the only star. There are excellent performances from Christopher Plummer (even older in his mid 80s) as his agent, Bobby Cannavale as his son, Jennifer Garner as his daughter-in-law, and Annette Bening as a hotel manager. Writer and director Dan Fogelman has given good lines and meaningful roles to his ensemble cast and it pays off a treat. And we get to hear some Lennon classics."
Danny Collins,Al Pacino was great in the movie.
Danny Collins,"I would have never cast him has Danny Collins. Danny Collins is suppose to be a big folk singer in the 1970's. They used old photos of Al from the 1970's as album covers, i think one still from the God father, which made Danny Collins music seem instance and Dark (my kind of folk), but the music actually done was very pop and sounded weird actually being sung by Pacino, who looks more like a lounge singer."
Danny Collins,"But the movie is not really about the music. Danny Collins is more about Collins attempting to charm his way into his son's life, a man who he has never met and has a family of his own."
Danny Collins,"Pacino may have been slightly miss cast, but the man was charming and funny and was lighting up the screen with his charisma. similar to his role in Sent of A Woman."
Danny Collins,Definitely go see if you are a Pacino fan.
Danny Collins,"""What would have happened if I got that letter when I was supposed to?"" Danny Collins (Pacino) is a rock star who peaked years ago. He is coasting through life playing concerts when he can and playing the same songs over and over. When he is shown a letter that John Lennon wrote him many years before he rethinks his life and career. With a new look at life he heads to New Jersey to find the son he never knew and start writing again. As many of you know by now I am a huge Pacino fan. I think he is the greatest actor working today but some of his recent movies I haven't been a big fan of. He was great in The Humbling but I thought the movie was a little slow. This is a role that seemed like a stretch for him (he does his own singing) but because he is so great he pulls it off and it seems like a role he was made for. The movie is very fun and easy to watch. The cast is great and the writing is funny and heartfelt. Only an actor like Pacino can turn a clichéd cheesy line like ""some dinners are worth fighting for"" into something that is meaningful. Overall, I am a little biased because Pacino is my favorite actor but this is a great movie and his best movie in a few years. I give it an A."
Danny Collins,"This movie is about aging and about finding a reason to live. An aging rock star, Danny Collins, who is still popular, receives a letter from a famous rock star, forty years after the letter was written. The letter contains advice that if followed, may have changed Danny's life for the better. Basically, the letter's message was that you don't have to let material things erode your creativity. The problem for Danny is that after forty years of performing, he now finds himself wallowing in that creative and spiritual rut that the letter warned him about. He hasn't written a new song in thirty years and the material he does perform over and over again is stale to the point of being toxic. None of his props - his huge house, expensive car, young fiancé, the alcohol, the drugs - help inspire him. He feels an emptiness that is nagging him. After reading the letter, Danny decides to retire. He does this in order to try to revive his creativity and prove to himself that he can still produce. The rest of the movie reveals more about Danny's character, showing that under all the the boozing and drugging there exists a decent person. To find out whether Danny finds happiness and fulfillment, watch the movie. Al Pacino gives a strong, yet appropriately nuanced performance as an aging man who is searching for meaning in his life. After decades of using music as much as an escape as well as a source of income, he finally begins to confront the truth about himself. What he discovers makes this movie worth watching."
Danny Collins,"I went into this movie not expecting much, although i love the cast outright. But i was entertained throughout because this movie has heart along with its humor. Writer-director Dan Fogelman's nicely-scripted plot unfolds at a decent pace, albeit a little predictably. Al Pacino, as usual, delivers a full-on performance which includes some decent singing and dancing. He is ably supported by Annette Bening as a reluctant love interest and Christopher Plummer as his faithful manager. The icing on this cake would be the soundtrack featuring songs by John Lennon, with the numbers beautifully worked in. Too bad that Jealous Guy couldn't be included."
Danny Collins,"Al Pacino puts on yet another good performance as an aging rock star who finds out that he received a letter from John Lennon and decides to make some changes in his life by getting to know his son's family. The soundtrack consisting of Lennon songs is really what helps the movie. It's not the most profound story, but who doesn't love hearing a Lennon song (whether with the Beatles or on his own)? Aside from Pacino, Annette Bening puts on the other really good performance. Her hotel clerk comes across as someone who needs as much of a change in her life as Danny needs in his. They both need a second chance, and Danny's quest for redemption just might be the opportunity."
Danny Collins,"That this is based on a true story makes it all the more interesting. A letter from John Lennon would be worth more than I can imagine. I hope that Steve Tilston appreciates what's in his possession, and I hope that he appreciates Al Pacino's performance."
Danny Collins,"In 1971, Danny admits to a that he finds imminent fame and fortune more terrifying than gratifying."
Danny Collins,"45 or so years later, we see that Danny was right to be worried, he is now a boozy, coked- up parody, singing the same hits to arenas full of ageing fans."
Danny Collins,"During his surprise birthday party, he is given a present from his best friend and manager Frank, a letter to Danny from John Lennon, sent to that journalist, who kept it all these years, telling him that you can get rich and still remain an artist, and inviting Danny to give him a call sometime so they could talk about music."
Danny Collins,"Danny sets off to New Jersey, setting up camp in a Hilton, and flirts with the hotel manager, Mary."
Danny Collins,"He now only has two goals, write a song that is meaningful to him, and build a relationship with his long-estranged son Tom, a construction worker who wants nothing to do with him........."
Danny Collins,"And with this movie, Pacino is finally back, showing us what an absolute the legend the man is. In my opinion, he hasn't been this good in a film since The Insider, and it's not just him, the story, the narrative, and the support is as just as awe-inspiring as the true story it's based on."
Danny Collins,"Fogelman handles the heavy parts of the story in a way that other film-makers should take notice of, whenever a scene is in danger of becoming over schmaltzy, there is an injection of spiteful humour thrown in to detract itself, and the audience."
Danny Collins,"Collins could be based on any ageing celebrity who is remembered, and still famous for having huge hits back in the day, and keeping his wealth by doing the same thing over and over and over. Englebert Humperdinck sprung to mind a few times whilst watching this."
Danny Collins,"It's no wonder that he's a hard drinking, drug taking shadow, the man knows he's a joke, an almost walking satire, but Pacino adds such a swagger to Collins, such a front, that it's not until the second act you realise that this is apparent, because of his numerous facades, it's almost chameleon like how Collins acts with different people."
Danny Collins,"The sub-plot involving his estranged son could have been an absolute disaster, but the fact that it's never too saccharine coated, and just that little bitter, adds depth to the narrative. Especially his subliminal message to himself when he leaves his Granddaughter.......the simple line 'Goodbye Hope' has many connotations in this film."
Danny Collins,"Plummer is wonderful, and he's the link to get Collins back on side with his son, a little monologue in the third act is handled wonderfully by Plummer, as again, humour prevents the film from becoming too schmaltzy."
Danny Collins,"If Pacino never made a film again, this would be a wonderful film to end an illustrious career, and I hope that he makes more like this, he owns the film, and even when his Collins is hungover, drunk, or sad, Pacino is effervescent in every scene."
Danny Collins,Welcome back Al.
Danny Collins,"Danny Collins comes from the director who brought you Crazy, Stupid, Love and this movie is another charmer in the same vein. As a truly delightful dramedy that thinks it's much edgier than it is, Danny Collins boasts a fabulous cast with great chemistry which becomes a low stakes tale of living your life the best way you can at any age."
Danny Collins,"Danny Collins (Al Pacino) is a very famous singer who, now in his elder years, has been reduced to singing the same repetitive hits on a tour where the average attendees are 50-60 year old women. When his manager Frank (Christopher Plummer) presents him with a birthday gift of a lost letter written to him from John Lennon almost forty years ago, Danny decides to change his life to the way he thinks it should have been had he gotten that letter originally. This sends him from LA to New Jersey to connect with the grown son he has never met."
Danny Collins,"Pacino is delightful and fun as the eccentric Collins. Danny is a normal man who let fame and money warp him into the typical aging rock star. In a story like this, you would expect someone like Danny to hit rock bottom, lose everything and then have to build himself back up to a better person and artist. This does not happen as Danny never in fact changes at all- he is just as bombastic, oblivious and creatively shallow as ever by the end of the film. But in a monologue given by the almighty Frank Grubman (Plummer) to Danny's estranged son, Danny is full of flaws but he has the best of hearts. Pacino gives a wonderful performance in a role that you can only describe as adorable and wanting him to be your awesome famous uncle."
Danny Collins,"Annette Bening plays Mary, the flustered hotel manager in New Jersey where Danny takes up temporary residence. Pacino and her have an easy and fun chemistry that lights up the screen when they are together. Mary starts out as someone Danny pursues and flirts with to her apprehensive delight, but she soon becomes his moral compass and you realize along with him that he may not be ready, or ever be ready to deserve her. Bobby Cannavale (Win Win) and Jennifer Garner (Dallas Buyers Club) give understated and beautiful performances as Danny's son and his pregnant wife. Both of these actors know how to play the straight to Pacino's Collins while also deep-rooting a sense of humanity in the film. The couple also has an adorable seven year old daughter who has the most sober looking case of ADHD ever seen."
Danny Collins,"Danny Collins wants you to think it is an edgy movie, but it's not. It plays like a family movie and the moral is certainly aimed to that dynamic. If not for the extreme overuse of the f-bomb and the gratuitous female full frontal in the beginning."
Danny Collins,"Never done this before, but here are two reviews of this film. Pick the one you like."
Danny Collins,The Positive Review
Danny Collins,"As he has so often done in his career, veteran actor Al Pacino takes this morality tale of a failed musician to heights never before imagined even by the screenwriter, and gives energy to a story which cannot fail to grab the viewer. Pacino's yeoman effort is aided abetted by Jennifer Garner and Annette Bening, both of whom infuse their characters with a spirit of optimism and decency which works well in counterpoint to Pacino's character, a character actually written in such a way that the audience, try as it will, cannot hope to see Danny Collins as simpatico. Props to Pacino for pulling this one out of the fire."
Danny Collins,And the Review done from the heart...
Danny Collins,"Not even the astonishing and proved talents of a 75 year old Al Pacino can give life to this dreary tale of a fading musician whose chance encounter with a communication from his past (a letter from John Lennon that was never delivered) spurs him to seek a path of redemption. Keep in mind that Mick Jagger himself is only 71, so for Pacino -- who can't sing a note -- to take on this role was the most astonishing thing in the movie, and it happened before the cameras rolled. Garner and Bening try to raise the energy level but frankly don't have the screen time. When the ultimate body of Pacino's work is catalogued, this will not be at the top the list. In fact, the whole film is such a downer that the reviewer is compelled to note that SAINT VINCENT had a similar theme yet produced a great movie following a similar arc. Forget Danny Collins. Find a copy of Saint Vincent."
Danny Collins,"Greetings again from the darkness. He who was once Michael Corleone is now Danny Collins. With a career spanning 40 plus years with 8 Oscar nominations, including a win for Scent of a Woman, Al Pacino must be considered Hollywood royalty. Upon closer analysis, that last nomination and win came more than 20 years ago, and he is now the go-to guy for a demonstrative, (more than a) few years past his prime type. So on paper, we get why Pacino was cast as Danny Collins (think modern day Neil Diamond)."
Danny Collins,"The film begins with a very young Collins being interviewed by a rock journalist (Nick Offerman) after the release of his first album. Flash forward 40 years, and Collins has made a career of re-hashing the same songs to the same concert goers. He lives in a mansion, throws lavish parties, has a fiancé who could be his granddaughter, and absorbs coke and booze between flights on his private jet. It's only now that Frank (Christopher Plummer), his agent and best friend, presents him with a long lost letter written to Collins by John Lennon after that interview so many years before. Cue the bells and whistles  it's time for a redemption road trip."
Danny Collins,"It's only at this point that we understand the cute ""kind of based on a true story"" tag at the opening credits. See, Lennon did write a letter in 1971 to British Folk Singer Steve Tilston, and the letter did take many years to find its way to him. However, Tilston never lost his creative vision the way that Danny Collins did (otherwise, there would be no movie)."
Danny Collins,"What happens next is predictable and a bit formulaic. Colllins tracks down his adult son (Bobby Cannavale) from an early career backstage fling, and does all he is capable of doing to cannonball into his life, and that of his wife (Jennifer Garner) and young daughter (Giselle Eisenberg). Expect the usual TV melodramatics as far as disease and suburban family challenges, and tie-in a flirty back-and-forth with the Hilton manager (Annette Benning), and you can pretty much fill in the blanks for the balance of the film."
Danny Collins,Cannavale and Plummer certainly do everything they can to elevate the storyline. Cannavale's emotions are all over the place as one would expect and he is the most believable of all characters. Plummer adds a sense of reality and humor to his interludes with Pacino – wisely controlling his movements against Pacino's histrionics.
Danny Collins,"Stories involving a characters seeking redemption have one thing in common  a character who is not so likable. We never really buy him as the aging rock star, or even as the once promising songwriter, but we do buy him as the guy who was too busy for his family and is clumsy and unaware of the pain he causes, even while trying to do the right thing."
Danny Collins,"Writer/director Dan Fogelman takes few risks in his first shot at directing. His past writing includes the excellent Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011) and the not so excellent Last Vegas (2013). His common theme seems to be the emotional struggle of men, and we definitely know that's an unsolved mystery. His effort here may not be a bull's-eye, but it's not without some merit – despite the Pacino distraction."
Danny Collins,". . . is the story of DANNY COLLINS, a true-life tale that's a classic American dream of wish-fulfillment. That's why the majority of Americans don't mind if the One Per Cent fix our laws and bribe our government so that they end up with 99% of this nation's wealth, as long as they each do a Good Deed every 40 years or so. DANNY COLLINS fritters away four decades leading a Life of Debauchery, with Al Pacino reprising his signature coke-nosed SCARFACE role as the title character here. He's never busted (unlike his manager, Frank) for doing drugs that are illegal for we 99%-Ers, since police dogs are smart enough NOT to bite the hand that feeds them. Finally, when it's time for Danny to think of his Legacy and Afterlife Opportunities, does he select a Random member of the 99% for his obligatory one Good Deed? Heck no! He simply makes his only son King for a Day. (That's right, an increasing number of the One Per Cent are beginning to realize that their ilk will be diluted unless they keep most of their own kids out in the Cold, scrimping and struggling to get by like everyone else.)"
Danny Collins,"Al Pacino made a lot of films over the years where he played cops or, more often, crooks and mobsters. As a result, he has through his choices, typecast himself just a bit. Additionally, so often in these sorts of roles, he is over the top...bigger than life, that's for sure. So, in light of this, it was a delight to see him in ""Danny Collins""...a very nice change of pace."
Danny Collins,"When the story begins, Danny is a world famous singer...much like a Neil Diamond or Tom Jones. But he also is pretty much coasting through life...existing but not living. After several failed marriages and a substance abuse addiction, he is a somewhat pitiful man despite his adoring fans."
Danny Collins,"After his birthday party, his agent (Christopher Plummer) hands him a letter that should have arrived for him decades before...a letter of encouragement from John Lennon himself! Well, the letter has an unexpected impact on Danny...and he decides to stop his whirlwind life and try to make up for some of his biggest mistakes in life. The biggest mistake is fathering a boy long ago...and never seeing him. The second biggest is his abandoning song writing long ago. Another is his drinking and drugs. This film is about his attempts to deal with each...and attempts is the operative word!"
Danny Collins,"The film has some marvelous acting and direction. While Pacino is no great singer (in interviews he was reported to apologize for it), he was wonderful in the lead...and less over-the-top than you'd expect. Overall, a wonderful 'little' film...and perhaps Pacino's attempt to do something new, just like Danny."
Danny Collins,"By the way, the story itself was inspired by a letter from Lennon and Yoko which arrived decades later to a young singer named Steve Stilston....though I am sure MANY details were changed for the film."
Danny Collins,"Danny Collins was once a young, relevant, up-and-coming rock performer: 40 years on, he is a fading superstar, churning out his hits with a conspicuous lack of passion to crowds of golden girls who follow him from gig to gig. It's a living. Then he is given a letter which John Lennon wrote to him at the start of his career, but which was stolen and secretly sold. He belatedly decides to accept the advice Lennon offers, so he cancels his tour, movies a piano into a hotel in New Jersey and starts writing songs again, and makes contact with the son he never met (who, understandably, is not charitably disposed towards the father who has ignored him his entire life)."
Danny Collins,"The lost Lennon letter actually happened, and is the jumping-on point for this ""inspired by true events"" movie. The cast is heavyweight – Al Pacino as Danny, Christopher Plummer as his long-time manager/best friend, Annette Bening as the manageress of the hotel at which he is staying, and with whom he enjoys an enormously entertaining running flirtation, and Jennifer Garner as son Mike's wife. Bobby Cannavale, less high profile, is Mike. I'm not a big fan of Cannavale or Garner, but they are both superb here (as, indeed, are Pacino and Bening). And it is also fair to mention Giselle Eisenberg, 6 (and already an old pro), who makes ADHD daughter Hope both adorable (without being obnoxious) and believable."
Danny Collins,"The heavyweight cast makes what is essentially a fairly slight story (which, nevertheless, doesn't always go exactly where you expect it to) seem to be more substantial than it actually is. There are no great truths here, just an engaging story about likable but flawed people trying to find their ways through the pitfalls which life throws at you (and, admittedly, having a rock star Dad is one of the more unusual examples)."
Danny Collins,"There are ten Lennon songs on the soundtrack, usually dropped in at plot-appropriate moments, one of which was so plot-appropriate that I choked up as soon as I heard the opening notes."
Danny Collins,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and I recommend it, especially if you are a Beatles/Lennon fan."
Danny Collins,"Review: I quite enjoyed this movie, which sees Al Pacino play a famous singer called Danny Collins who has a young fiancé, loads of money and a alcohol and cocaine habit. On his birthday he receives a gift from his best friend Frank Grubman (Christopher Plummer), which is a letter written to him from John Lennon, saying that he should stay true to his music, so he takes his kind words on board and decides to leave his fiancé and stay in a hotel near his son who he hasn't seen since he was little boy. He also stops his tour so he can write new material, with the help of the hotel manager, Mary Sinclair (Annette Benning), who he has the hots for. When he finally goes to his sons house, he gets to meet his young granddaughter and his wife Samantha (Jennifer Garner) who he gets on with fine but as soon as his son Tom (Bobby Cannavale) comes home from work, he tells him to leave because he has nothing but bitter feelings towards his father. Mary then advises him to carry on pursuing a relationship with his son so he decides to help them out financially and he puts his granddaughter in a highly rated school. He then finds out that his money is running out because of his lavish life style and the only way he can carry on living the high life is by going back on the road, which he can now approach with a different outlook on life. This is definitely a feel good movie about a man whose looking for a purpose in life. I liked the chemistry between Pacino and Plummer and the sweet love story between Pacino and Mary was very well written and light-hearted fun. His son was a bit arrogant at the beginning but when he started to accept his father, I liked watching them bond together. His little granddaughter cracked me up but Al Pacino's singing and performing was pretty awful. Anyway, it a watchable movie with some emotional and touching scenes but Pacino has still got a way to go before he reaches the performances of his younger years. Watchable!"
Danny Collins,"Round-Up: Although this movie lost money at the box office, it's not as bad as a lot of the projects that Pacino has brought out lately. At 75 years old, he's still remembered as Tony Montana in Scarface or Don Corleone in the Godfather and everyone is hoping that he comes out with another gangster movie before he gives up acting for the big screen. After a string of disappointing movies like Righteous Kill, Stand Up Guys, the appalling Jack & Jill, the Last Act and the Son of No One, he really is starting to lose his credibility as one of the best actors in the world. He still has a unique acting style which has made him a worldwide star but his choices of movies have really been awful in the latter part of his career. He has a role in the upcoming Martin Scorsese movie, the Irishman, alongside Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci and Harvey Keitel but he takes a long time to bring out movies so I doubt that we will be seeing that project finished in 2015. Anyway, this movie was written and directed by Dan Fogelman who wrote Crazy, Stupid Love, Cars & Cars 2, Fred Claus, Bolt, Tangled, the Guilt Trip and Last Vegas. He's not new to the comedy game but this is the first movie that he has directed so it's a shame that it didn't make back it's money. The fact that the whole John Lennon letter concept was true, made this dramatic comedy a joy to watch but it's not one that will go down as a classic. There are different elements that spice up the storyline but Pacino's name isn't enough to guarantee money at the box office anymore."
Danny Collins,Budget: $10million Worldwide Gross: $7.5million
Danny Collins,I recommend this movie to people who are into their comedy/drama/music about a famous singer who starts to question his morals after receiving a 40 year old letter from John Lennon to him. 5/10
Danny Collins,"First of all, I have to start by saying it felt really weird to see a super saying the movie was ""sort of based on a true story"". Sorry, but it is either based on true events or it's not. I guess it's only a trick to catch people's attention a little more"
Danny Collins,"The movie was OK, but it won't leave a long lasting impression. As for Al Pacino, the guy is an excellent actor, but for him to play a musician on the brink of retirement and to force him to show his singing skills was probably a bit of a mistake. He is such an awful singer that you wonder if the guy is singing or having a heart attack. Either way, it makes you question why they chose him and not someone else for the role I suppose Al Pacino is still Al Pacino."
Danny Collins,"Also, I feel that you never really get the point of the Lennon letter, which is supposed to be central to this movie (Probably the reason why they made a movie only ""mildly based"" on true events). They had to add a lot of substance to this letter story to turn it into a movie. You could say it is the eye opener that makes Pacino reach out for his son and try to change his empty life around before it's too late. But that in itself makes the letter seem unimportant. Basically, you sense that the same story could have been told without the letter."
Danny Collins,"All in all, a decent movie but I really wonder how long it will stuck to your mind, I give it half a day."
Danny Collins,Danny Collins (2015)
Danny Collins,*** (out of 4)
Danny Collins,"Drugged out rock star Danny Collins (Al Pacino) receives a letter from John Lennon, which was written nearly forty years earlier but never reached him. The letter inspires Collins to get his life back in order so he moves into a small hotel room in New Jersey where he starts to write new material closer to his heart. While doing he he tries to win over the hotel manager (Annette Bening) as well as try to connect with the son (Bobby Cannavale) he never knew."
Danny Collins,"DANNY COLLINS isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination but it's certainly a nice little gem that really stands apart from most pictures like it. This true story had a major selling point in that many of Lennon's classics are on hand here used for the soundtrack and they also help tell the story, which was pretty cool to listen to. Obviously, this story changed around for entertainment purposes but it's still a nice little story about redemption and family."
Danny Collins,There's no doubt that the cast is certainly a high point as Pacino really sinks his teeth into this character and makes it quite memorable. There's not any screaming and in reality it's one of the most laid back characters that he's ever played and this was quite refreshing to see. There are so many quieter moments here that the actor really nails including an incredibly touching finale that I certainly won't ruin. Bening makes for a good love interest and I enjoyed that the screenplay didn't run this into the ground with clichés. Cannavale and Jennifer Garner are both good in their roles and especially Cannavale who had a pretty difficult role. Christopher Plummer is also good no matter what he does.
Danny Collins,I think one of the most refreshing things was the direction by Dan Fogelman. Nothing in the film is overly flashy and it's not trying to be some crowd-pleaser but instead it's just about a lot of tender and small moments in the life of a man trying to get everything back on track. Technically speaking the film is very impressive but there's no question that it's heart and performances are the best thing.
Danny Collins,Greetings from Lithuania.
Danny Collins,"""Danny Collins"" (2015) is a bit formulaic, predictable but still a highly enjoyable movie. The cast is great, although no Oscars will shine in here, everyone did a great job. Pacing in this movie is great - at running time 1 h 42 min this movie never drags and is a joy to watch from start till finish. It doesn't tell an original story, but it's an involving one."
Danny Collins,"Overall, ""Danny Collins"" is best seen with no high expectations. There isn't anything special or original, yet everything is done so well that it's nearly impossible to stop watching it after you started."
Danny Collins,"Al Pacino has always been one of my favorites and with this latest independent hit""Danny Collins"" it was a real sentimental feel good winner! Pacino is Danny Collins a down on his luck past his prime fading singer who after finding an uncovered letter from John Lennon decides to change his life and his ways! Maybe the days of alcohol and hard living and hard partying might be over! This even inspires Danny(Al) to reconnect with his manager and his family look for true love and even embark on a second act. This film is a must see it's touching with a sentimental story of search, discovery, rediscovery and connecting with love and family thumbs up for Danny Collins!"
Danny Collins,"It doesn't take a genius to figure out that moviegoers love Al Pacino. He's an appealing actor. He's a likable actor. Heck, he's simply a legend. He is however, heavily miscast playing an aging rocker in 2015's Danny Collins (the film I'm about to review). This is an uneven performance complete with a veritable level of patchiness. Al as demonstrated in ""Collins"", is not much of a singer. He also looks a little counterfeit playing the piano. At a running time of 106 minutes, you sense that Serpico is only in these proceedings for total name recognition. He ventures over to his softer side like he did in 2002's Simone but you kinda wish he'd just stick to being gangster. There are other actors more suitable to take his place here."
Danny Collins,"Written and directed by Dan Fogelman (his first stint behind the camera) and inspired by the life of known, folk singer Steve Tilston (I'm thinking what's on screen is somewhat fictional since the opening titles say ""this is kind of a true story, sort of""), Danny Collins is the type of film that mildly begins while not having an actual ending. The screenplay is from the land of vapid. Fogelman (as mentioned in the last sentence) penned The Guilt Trip which I reviewed two years ago. In that write up, I talked about how his script was achingly thin and lacked bite. Ditto here for ""Collins"". This is 2015's Almost Famous as in almost, not quite. It's also Jerry Maguire minus the gerrymandering, a real disappointment to say the least."
Danny Collins,"The story commences at L.A.'s Greek Theatre. Danny Collins (played by Al ""I wear the same outfits in the movies as I do in the public eye"" Pacino) is set to go on and entertain a sold out show. He's a washed up singer, a guy who hasn't had a hit song in over forty years. But there he is, getting thousands of fans to spew the words to his signature hook, ""Hey, Baby Doll"" (just think a poor man's version of a Neil Diamond ditty). Now Danny seems to have a lot of money. He should be happy but he's not. He's got fancy cars, a mansion, a private jet, and plenty of senior citizens who'll pay to watch his tired concerts. He also drinks like a fish, does cocaine out of a cross (around his neck), and has a young fiancé who cheats on him. Anyway, he decides that his life now needs a little dose of redemption. His inspiration: A letter written to him over four decades ago. The author: The late, great John Lennon. After reading said letter, Danny decides to forgo the rest of his tour and do two important things. He's gonna try to write some brand new songs (which we the audience don't exactly get a chance to hear) and fly to New Jersey to form a relationship with the son he never met (Tom Donnelly played by Bobby Cannavale). Throughout everything, you get to hear background music via John Lennon's greatest hits album, The John Lennon Collection. Lennon's songs are sledgehammered to remind you of Danny's promise to change his life and go straight. They seem however, to mask the fact that his written words to Danny aren't mentioned enough with their purpose being sort of ill-defined. This gives ""Collins"" an inconsistent tone as funny/despairing fodder."
Danny Collins,"Erraticness and unhealthy, rock star vices aside, I mentioned in the first paragraph that Pacino is out of place in the role of a second rate Frankie Valli. He's not the only one. Almost every co-star here is the victim of some sort of miscasting mishap. A fine actor in his own right, I really didn't buy Christopher Plummer as Frank Grubman (Danny's 85 year-old manager, uh huh). I also couldn't picture Jennifer Garner as a lower class housewife in Samantha Donnelly (Pacino's estranged son's spouse). Finally, I found Annette Bening to be underdeveloped and unnecessary playing Pacino's character's no-touch love interest. They have okay chemistry but I was kinda hoping their tryst wasn't such a nondescript tease. Honestly, the only actor that didn't strike me as being miscast was Bobby Cannavale. That's probably because he pretty much looked like he could be related to Pacino."
Danny Collins,"As for the screenplay which doesn't do the actors/actresses justice to begin with, I thought it was airy and lacking in research when it came to the intricacies of rock 'n' roll. Dan Fogelman would rather give his players cringe-inducing dialogue to occupy (almost every character interaction has this) than delve into the raucousness of musical stenography and has-been hedonism. Touting itself as an uneven mix of comedy and drama, Danny Collins provides us with zingers at the end of each scene that seem to flop in the wind."
Danny Collins,"All in all, this is a film with dangling loose ends, a sort of VH1's Where Are They Now? without a true emotional tug. It tries to succeed with some good intentions and I like the fact that (spoiler alert) it takes the viewer down a darker pathway via the notion of Pacino's character's son being stricken with a blood disease. However, the bulk of it is ultimately featherweight material at best. In the future, I'm looking forward to something better (musically) like The Who documentary, Lambert & Stamp. Nevertheless, here's my overall rating: 2 stars."
Danny Collins,"Yes, based on a true story but you know how that goes - artistic license and money pursuit means there's going to be a lot of embellishment, deletions, and flat out made-ups."
Danny Collins,"Movie starts out engaging especially the dialogue - witty, sarcastic, poignant, etc. Acting matched as well. Then  it all starts to fall apart like wheels stuck and spinning in the same rut. It not only got tiresome (hearing the same stuff over and over) (i.e. stuff meaning poor ego rich me, drugs, booze, sex innuendo), but it really got cliché overload with dad making amends with cast off son (with subsequent discord of course) plot hook. And, to make it a double hook to catch the fish (audience) is the old standby of son is inflicted with a life ending illness scripted in to provide dad an opportunity to be a more likable guilty rich dude."
Danny Collins,"I absolutely loved this movie. It can be so sad and painful that one incident, just one incident, can have a profound effect on your life. Danny not receiving John Lennon's letter until decades later affected his life in ways he could not begin to imagine. How different his life could have been had he known John Lennon wanted to talk with him and he then actually contacted Lennon? Danny's one-night fling with Tom's mother, which resulted in Tom being born, had an effect on Danny's life. How different would both Danny and Tom's lives would have been if they have had a father and son relationship throughout the years."
Danny Collins,"The acting was superb and the plot was genuinely heartfelt. I absolutely loved this movie. Al Pacino is my favorite actor, and I've seen mostly all of his movies, but this movie was the one that moved me the most. He missed out on so much in life because of missed opportunities, and later in life, he had the chance to rectify and make up for what he had missed. It is never to late to repair the damage. Excellent movie."
Danny Collins,Everything a good drama should not be.
Danny Collins,"I went into the theatres with high hopes for this one, being a big Pacino fan. But boy I came out disappointed. It is a movie that wastes its hours on mediocrity, sometimes goes into the abyss of clumsiness and pointless melodrama. It stays away from profundity and lacks the luster of sentience. It was like watching a bunch of random guys act animatedly, to words that had no direction and that were headed nowhere. Screenplay so mediocre! It was like listening to random people talk. Humor was pathetic too."
Danny Collins,Danny Collins began on a great note but then slowly died down as it stumbled with its poor script. The movie seemed to open with a strong musical backdrop but unfortunately it didn't even skim its surface. Lennon is only a reference. Even the transition of Danny doesn't exhilarate you. It is a very slow paced movie that simply scrambles towards the finish line without packing a good redemption.
Danny Collins,"If we try to focus on the good, the beginning bit with Nick Offerman was quite exceptional. Annette does a fair job with her role. Giselle Eisenberg is the cutest thing, who makes your heart melt with her sweet voice. Also the song that Danny seems to be penning turns out pretty good. Sometimes you could almost see the subtlety of Fogelman's direction when he manifests fingers knocking on the door even when there was a doorbell. Danny's disregard for his life and his decision to do what his audience loved was also brilliantly shown."
Danny Collins,"The fact that a lot of people knew Danny Collins was overused and eventually it just became sad. At the end it just seemed like a story heading towards a blank. There wasn't truly any inspiration. Barely a decision that got cashed out for a change. You could almost tell why this movie had Annette Bening, Josh Peck, Giselle, Jennifer Garner and Christopher Plummer - simply to spice things up and make things interesting."
Danny Collins,I would only recommend it if you wish to see a movie where things don't go dark or grim and that is strewn with mediocre pleasantries.
Barely Lethal,"I'm not sure why this one is being slammed so much. I thought it was silly, fun entertainment. Totally harmless fluff but what's wrong with that? Hailee Steinfeld leads a great cast, none of whom disappoint. Nice to see Sophie Turner in a role light years away from Game of Thrones. I thought Jessica Alba and Sam Jackson were both good. Alba seems to be having the time of her life. Rachael Harris and Rob Huebel are both hilarious. Jason Ian Drucker is a little scene stealer. He's great every time he's on screen. I loved his part in the final battle. It's somewhat reminiscent of the Spy Kids movies but less annoying and not as much cartoonery. Yes it's by-the-numbers in most respects but it's just trying to entertain, not reinvent cinema as we know it. Most of the complaints I see are from people saying the movie ""could have been more/better."" Well you just described 99% of movies. There's always room for improvement. Why don't we just judge it by what it is not what we wish it was? I think it's a fun lightweight teenage action comedy that has appeal for young and old alike. And that's enough for me."
Barely Lethal,"I decided to watch this movie because Samuel L. Jackson was in it. I found it on Netflix and had not even heard about it prior to stumbling upon it. I read the synopsis, but wasn't overly reeled in by it, as it had that teenage-generic-action-comedy vibe to it."
Barely Lethal,"I will say that ""Barely Legal"" actually turned out to be far better than I had initially hoped or thought it would be, given the synopsis for the movie. And it turned out to be rather entertaining. Sure, it had those sappy moments that are seen in these particular movies, but it worked out well enough."
Barely Lethal,"The storyline, despite being so generic and predictable that it was oozing off of it, actually still turned out to be entertaining for what it was. This doesn't challenge the viewer intellectually, so just unwind, lean back and enjoy the ride."
Barely Lethal,"They had some good performers in the movie, and it was nice to see Jessica Alba in the role that she had. And of course Samuel L. Jackson was good, just a shame that he hadn't a more prominent role to play. Hailee Steinfeld actually turned out to be a rather good choice for the lead, as she definitely stood her ground and performed well."
Barely Lethal,"All in all, you know what you are getting yourself into here with a movie such as this, and the movie does play on every available trick that has been seen before in similar movies. But it still worked out quite well."
Barely Lethal,Not all movies can be epic.
Barely Lethal,"I went into the theater not expecting much, even though such actors as Sam L. Jackson and Jessica Alba names appeared on the movie poster. The movie has a really cool concept:"
Barely Lethal,"Sam L Jackson trains an army of underage girls to be government assassins, but his most skilled agent, number 83 seeks to regain her childhood by becoming a normal teenager after her last mission gave her the opportunity to fake her own death."
Barely Lethal,"It's been a while since I've seen Jessica Alba in a flick so it's cool to see her in this as the villain, though the movie centers more around Number 83, played by Hailee Steinfeild and how a teenager who does not know how to be a teenager learns how to be one. This plot turned the big named stars like Jackson and Alba's role in the movie into nothing but overblown cameos. You can actually tell from the way it's filmed that both of them were just collecting a pay check."
Barely Lethal,"Barely Lethal had the makings of a great teen comedy. It had an interesting concept that the filmmakers were able to show off in the movie. It was put together nicely with action an comedy that made for a fun flick, but it won't go down in history with the John Hughes flicks from the 80s or American Pie franchise."
Barely Lethal,But I still found it worthy to take a look at.
Barely Lethal,"Imagine rifling through your DVD collection and grabbing Salt, Get Smart, 16 Candles & Fatal Attraction and throwing them all into a blender. Aside from getting a lot of DVD splinters in your face, you'll get an experience like none other."
Barely Lethal,"""Barely Lethal"" is the story of a teenage girl who is a highly trained assassin but she can't survive a week in high school. The setup is brilliant. Almost satirical, but not quite, it takes us to the realm of utter absurdity, but underneath it all is a solid metaphor about the difficulties of adolescence. This is a timeless story which is why it's fun for all ages & demographics. I'm male and old enough that I saw ""The Breakfast Club"" in the movie theater when it came out ...and I loved this flick."
Barely Lethal,"If you are prepared for some wild wtf swings in plot, tone, theme and presentation (or even better, if you can see it as part of this film's charm) then you might love this flick, too. In the Making-Of bonus features, you can see that the entire cast is having a blast and acting like teenagers during filming. This translates into great on-screen chemistry as well as some genuine silly fun. As 40-year-old Dan Fogler (the hilarious Mr. Drumm) says, ""My maturity level definitely dropped a few points."""
Barely Lethal,"The comedy is mostly situational; in other words there aren't a ton of punchline gags & snappy zingers, but there are several great LOL moments worth the price of admission. There are also some wonderfully unexpected role-reversals, such as the scene where our nerdy heroine meets the cheerleader gang for the first time. And I saved the best for last: the climactic fight scene! Physically impressive, dramatically intense, and logistically HILARIOUS (it happens on the dance floor at homecoming), the action in this flick may be over the top, but that's sorta the point. A+ for originality in being the only teen romance flick in history which takes us to a knockdown, dragout, punchbowl shattering fight scene at a dance. If you can get past the ""wtf"" factor, you'll have a great time."
Barely Lethal,"People don't seem to like this movie and i'm not sure why. yes it's formulaic, yes it's cliché, but I still think it's fun! What can i say, i'm a sucker for girly teen movies."
Barely Lethal,"This film is very predictable, but I like that it's a mix between a high school movie and an action/spy movie. there is not a lot of character development but I still liked the characters and I understood their motives. Samuel L. Jackson's was hilarious as Hardman and Hailee Steinfeld was well cast as the main character Megan Walsh."
Barely Lethal,"For me there where laugh-out-loud moments, I think the movie had a great sense of humour that made it upbeat and witty."
Barely Lethal,"This movie was charming and a ton of fun. I certainly see why people would think its dumb or even stupid because of its formulaic nature, but i liked it. A feel-good movie that is very charming and entertaining."
Barely Lethal,"Really Enjoyed this movie, this did rather reminded me of So Undercover which Miley Cyrus starred in a few years ago. However this was much better, not as cheesy!"
Barely Lethal,"Barely Lethal is Very much a teen movie and predominantly for a female/teen audience. Haley Stanford plays lead role of a girl who wants to be a 'Normal teenager and experience a life of school and boys' but is unable to due to her training as a child to be an assassin. Very cliché and predictable but never the less, it is great. A Feel good movie which is great for the whole family!"
Barely Lethal,"Good cast with this movie to, Nice to see Jessica Alba and Jaime King making an appearance. Deserves more credit, and better ratings than 5.5 !"
Barely Lethal,"The movie idea is really nice, genuine and fresh , the events are connected perfectly and the script looked really tight.. even though there were some predictability in it and the trailer kinda exposed most of the story but i still weirdly found it intriguing and catchy."
Barely Lethal,"The genre was all about ""Action | Adventure | Comedy"" but honestly the ""real"" action element only presented in the first mission we saw agent 83 does and in the last fight with 84 , so to me the Humorous Comedy shown by most of the cast was really good and it made the movie more appealing."
Barely Lethal,"As for the cast, i will state those who were really awesome in the movie and did their part really well and those who were just okay, Samuel L. Jackson he was amazing with a spot on performance, This year i'v watched also in Big Game and he got the same lovable personality .. Dan Fogler, Gabriel Basso and Rob Huebel they were hilarious and i wished to see more of them.. as for Thomas Mann the guy from project x maybe the script didn't give him a chance to do much ... Sophie Turner was just good did what were asked from her ,, i mean to be fair did more than what i saw in game of thrones ;D Rachael Harris appearance was nice , and not trying to be harsh but Dove Cameron was literally acting like she wasn't into the role ... but anyway it doesn't matter .. the movie went fine."
Barely Lethal,"So Overall, it is a nice movie and suitable for family night ,, the amazingly balanced funny script and the nice performance by the cast made it look like this."
Barely Lethal,"After a viewing at 1am I am pretty satisfied with the overall film, I didn't go in to this expecting a life altering message or acting that would move me, for what it is the film done the job; light, airy, a predictable yet enjoyable watch."
Barely Lethal,"The main draw to this film was the cast, I enjoyed Hailee Steinfeld in Enders Game and thought the somewhat masculine performance would carry well, her commitment was visible and seemed genuine (as much as could be) in the role of a deadly teenage girl. Sophie Turner being another name that caught my eye sadly didn't live up, I feel disappointed with her acting, getting the underlining sense it was half arsed-although the American accent may have been a factor in throwing off her game as well as living up to the stereotypical 'agent' robotic personality. The acting was OK."
Barely Lethal,"This isn't a film I would personally run to tell my friends about, partly due to the shame of a 22 year old man liking chick-flick-esque films but mainly due to the rushed style of structure. The screenplay let this one down, rushed and again, half arsed. The small roles such as Jaime King's annoyed me slightly too but that could be a personal thing."
Barely Lethal,"All in all my verdict is, surprisingly, worth a watch. I never really swear off watching something a second time but this will be one I won't be thinking about again until it shows up on film4. Don't expect too much and you'll have a 'nice' hour and forty minutes :)"
Barely Lethal,"Ideas that don't meet their potential are the bete noire of film reviews. In theory every movie that has ever been made could potentially have benefited from one more rewrite, one more tweak, before going before the cameras."
Barely Lethal,"And then there is this film. Arguably the ""poster child"" for scripts that weren't quite ready for primetime. The irony is that the idea is rock-solid; and, even more ironic, something Hollywood (A-List Hollywood, not backlot Hollywood) had seemingly missed."
Barely Lethal,"I am betting the logline for this was something like ""Trained teen female killer ready for anything ... except High School,"" or something close."
Barely Lethal,Totally agree with earlier reviewers that every possible chance for getting a scene right was wrecked or ruined in favor of bad dialog and shaky acting.
Barely Lethal,"Clichés abound. They actually leap off the screen and bang you on your head to make sure you get the ""joke"" (like the substitute mom whose every piece of advice sounds oddly like an apology for something she herself did when she was young ... or the father who tries so hard to talk his son that he sounds like an SNL skit)."
Barely Lethal,Could have been a contender. Really.
Barely Lethal,This was a thoroughly enjoyable ride from a fresh director and features great performances from three promising young actresses.
Barely Lethal,"Hailee Steinfeld continues to show her versatility as Megan, a trained assassin who just wants to be a normal teenager. Dove Cameron gives a strong performance as the daughter of the host family. I hope to see her in many more movies. Sophie Turner plays Megan's nemesis and has less scenes, but shines in the ones she's in, especially in the end. I'm very much looking forward to seeing her in the title role of X-Men: Dark Phoenix."
Barely Lethal,The guys in this flick are mostly ornaments. Good old Samuel L. J. and Jessica Alba also play second fiddle here to the youngsters.
Barely Lethal,"Definitely worth a watch. Some action, some high school drama, very much fun. Looking out for more from director Kyle Newman."
Barely Lethal,"Sign me up NOOOOW! I love this move; it's simple however very endearing. I love Hailee Steinfeld. She's super gorg. Barely Lethal is really original, cute fun that's terrifically geared towards female teens. I love young Sophie Turner as the rival spy and Jessica Alba too has a great part in this and is really good. I love Jessica Alba so much. Barely Lethal is a 1-of-a-kind adventure."
Barely Lethal,"First off let me point out that even though Samuel L Jackson and Jessica Alba gets top-billing they are just co-stars, important co-stars but co- stars none the less that show up every now and then in the movie."
Barely Lethal,The real lead however is Hailee Steinfeld who plays a teenage assassin gone AWOL in order for her to live a normal life and a lot of the focus of the movie is her trying to adjust to (a extremely typical American movie) high school.
Barely Lethal,And although there is very little groundbreaking material in the script it did manage to keep me entertained through out the running time and I did find myself laughing here and there.
Barely Lethal,"The movie is rated PG-13 so all the violence and gags etc are fairly harmless (although initially the film received an R-rating, the film-makers appealed and got their PG-13 without having to cut anything out, so just barely PG-13 then)."
Barely Lethal,"Sophie Turner from Game Of Thrones is a co-star and she get to show that she can kick some ass as well which was cool, Dan Fogler is pretty funny as a teacher and there is a cameo from one of the guys in Jackass (won't say who as that might take away the surprise factor a bit) but he was funny as well."
Barely Lethal,So yeah overall nothing amazing but perfectly watchable when you're looking for some mindless popcorn entertainment.
Barely Lethal,I needed a break from the real world and this did the trick. It just about clears average and is perfectly watchable. I thought some of the riffs on the tropes of teen comedy were amusing for anyone who'd seen the originals - although I have to admit I didn't laugh an awful lot. It is what it is: not every film can be an oscar contender.
Barely Lethal,"Hey, chill out all you Roger Ebert wannabees. This is a simple teenage comedy, but it is fun so just relax and enjoy it...it's called entertainment no Oscar trash. I thoroughly enjoyed this film, devoid of f-bombs, drugs, profanity and propaganda...it's simply a comedy if you can remember what those were like. AND for lovers of puns...you'll get this flick."
Barely Lethal,"Megan Walsh (Hailee Steinfeld) is 83. She, Heather 84 (Sophie Turner), and other girls are trained to be assassins by Hardman (Samuel L. Jackson). She grows tired of her work and pines to be a regular high school girl. During an operation to capture Victoria Knox (Jessica Alba), she escapes and pretends to be an exchange student from Regina, Canada. Her host family is a divorced mother (Rachael Harris), snarky teen Liz Larson (Dove Cameron), and little boy Parker. All she knows about high school is from teen comedies which gets her into trouble. Both hunky musician Cash Fenton and AV nerd Roger Marcus take a liking to her."
Barely Lethal,"This has a few IT girls on the rise. There are a surprising amount of talent, both kids and adults, in a silly teen movie. It does try to subvert the teen movie tropes. It's just weird that it does it in a childish style. It struggles to find its true voice. It's both sincere and sarcastic. Steinfeld is sincerity incarnate. The set up is stupider than Spy Kids. It's an awkward blend that fails to be compelling. The only compelling aspect is that one roots for Hailee but this is stupid and not in a fun way."
Barely Lethal,"It's also very aware of 90s teen comedies and movies in general. Samuell L. Jackson might be the scariest, cutest drill Sergeant ever. A fine line he has to walk and he does a fine job. Jessica Alba seems to be content in playing smaller roles now (or at least that's what I've been seeing of her lately)."
Barely Lethal,"The main focus lies on the teenage girl who's our main character and represents the more film educated younger audiences nowadays. That is played out well and what you can also like, is the fact that she's empowered and strong. Even though I also always say, it's just a movie, it's nice to create ""role models"" like that. Obviously I don't mean to be exactly like her, but to believe in yourself and go your way (something of a message this movie also has apart from just trying to be entertaining)."
Barely Lethal,"Candy coated, sure, but not without poignancy. Above-par acting and a great cast elevate this slightly formulaic farce. Close your cold hard eye and have fun with this one. Some laugh-out-loud moments and great fight choreography. Hope to see the talented lead actress in more films."
Barely Lethal,"Let this be your definite guide. Want a hard action movie? Think that because Samuel L. Jackson is in it, it might be? Nope. This is not for you. You'd only end up exasperated, criticising it."
Barely Lethal,"As for the name sounding like BARELY LEGAL, so damn why the fuss about that? Name's cute enough. Just don't think you're gonna score with it that way. No, NAKED WEAPON it certainly ain't. Look elsewhere."
Barely Lethal,"So don't expect the big Action or the big Naughty. Expect a chick flick about a young girl trained as an assassin. With a bit of naughty thrown in, but really not for the guys..."
Barely Lethal,"Haylee Steinfield is cute, yeah, gets even cuter the more she grows on you. Love the fringe! What little there is of underplayed Sophie Turner gets a big mention. Magnificent long red tresses. Dove Cameron steals every scene she is in."
Barely Lethal,"Hilarious car chase scene. Funny quote by Dove best line in movie ""You are sketchier than a 2 AM waffle house"" Jessica Alba here blonde so no DARK ANGEL, still has those moves."
Barely Lethal,Ol' Samuel training three-year-olds to be assassins sure takes the cake crowning his tough guy career :)
Barely Lethal,I detected a definitive BEVERLY HILLS 90210 vibe. Megan WALSH and what with the two leads looking like Brenda and Kelly and kinda quite similar in many ways...
Barely Lethal,"Seems to have been made as a TV pilot for cable perhaps, or obviously with a sequel in mind, with Heather returning for college mayhem."
Barely Lethal,Definitely not as bad as its score on Rotten Tomatoes would have you believe. Guess those people expected something else...
Barely Lethal,"But what it is, is way better than its undeserved bad rep."
Barely Lethal,"Teen girl's film, but no usual romance-comedy. There are some small clichés, but being it is an action film, those parts looked kind of small. Yeah, nice casting. Hailee was really cool. The 'Descendant' girl Dove was good as well. The rest of cameos like Samuel L. Jackson and Alba was fine. It was from the director of 'Fanboys'. It tells the story of a girl trained to be an assassin from a very young age who escapes the centre to live a normal life in the real world. And that's where she struggles to blend in, as well as to overcome from the tailing troubles of the past."
Barely Lethal,"A well entertaining film, if you are not expecting anything big. It got a few great action sequences. Except Sam L. Jack, it is totally a chick film and most probably suitable for everyone for viewing. I enjoyed it, but I don't think I want a sequel for it. Particularly business wise that won't do well as this one was not received well by the film critics. Despite I approve it for a go, the rating wise it is just an average film. Sometimes that's where opinion divides for a film about what we felt watching it and how we're going to rate it later on."
Barely Lethal,6/10
Barely Lethal,"The idea behind Barely Lethal is that the government has some sort of top secret program that adopts orphan girls and trains them to be ninja-like assassins. Sounds a bit like Spy Kids and at least the first Spy Kids film was good. So, I went into watching this film with relatively high expectations--especially when it's billed as a comedy. Plus the boss is played by Samuel L. Jackson...and everyone loves Samuel L. Jackson, right?"
Barely Lethal,"There is trouble brewing at this secret agency. Megan (Hailee Steinfeld) is a great little killer but secretly she harbors a dream to be a normal teenage girl. When it looks like she's been killed on a mission she decides to use this opportunity to disappear and reinvent herself as a high school student so that she can experience a normal life. So why did the film utterly fail for me? Well, the film appeared to be a comedy but almost never made me laugh. A HUGE infusion of humor really would have helped. It was at times just too serious. Additionally, the film much like any teen film--with the same clichés (such as the nerdy but nice guy she meets but ignores until she finally realizes he's dreamy...just like I saw in The Duff and several other teen films) and same inappropriate content (such as the hilarious notion of calling one of the characters 'Rape-it Ralph'--which is about as funny as jokes about pedophilia or cancer). The bottom line is that the film started off with nice credits, an interesting premise and then it just went nowhere for me. In the film's defense, I am not exactly the target audience but shouldn't any audience deserve a bit better than a by the numbers teen film that promises to be different but really, down deep, isn't? Plus...Rape-it Ralph?!?!"
Barely Lethal,"If you care, the film was just released on DVD this week to Netflix but I think you could do so much better, such as the great OLD teen movie Better Off Dead...now THAT is a funny and original teen movie!"
Barely Lethal,"Barely Lethal (2015). With Samuel L. Jackson, this teenage comedy espionage action thriller barely makes itself into a better than average, and almost quite good movie in fact. While this adolescent comedy has a great refreshing edginess to it, there have been so many great assassin movies out there that this movie had some high bars to reach. What really let this for the most part solid movie down was the climactic scenes which unfortunately required a lot more experience as writer of action thrillers. The most important part of the movie was let down by a rather traditional, uninspiring competition between the leading oppositional characters. Other really endearing and light-hearted espionage movies that hit their mark are: Wild Target (2010), Daisy & Violet (2011), Miss Meadows (2014), American Ultra (2015), and Wanted (2008)."
Barely Lethal,"There must be a shortage of capable men, that's why women now seem to be the ones taking over in saving the world (if not doing something that only men usually do). Well, at least, that's how it looks in movies. We've seen Katniss Everdeen and Tris Prior lead powerful rebellions against their respective ironfisted governments, Clary Fray battle demons and supernaturals, and Jupiter Jones get crowned as the cosmic queen. I mean, from becoming mere sexual objects for playboy billionaires, they've gone as far as being the supreme leader of the universe, what else can these women do just so they could equate themselves with men? What about as an international assassin?"
Barely Lethal,"In Barely Lethal, 16 year-old Megan Walsh (not her real name) is a trained international assassin. This premise already engages interest and holds so much potential, but it fails to deliver a satisfying result. The problem begins when Megan leaves the academy where little girls are trained to become assassins. She fakes her death and enrolls herself in a suburban highschool, hoping everything is going to be normal. Only it turns out it isn't as easy as it seems. From here, the trajectory of the narrative disappoints immensely. It begins undermining the capacity of its lead character by dismissing the fact that she is a trained killer, exposing her vulnerabilities and teenage dramas, instead. This isn't a totally a insane idea, she's 16-year old, after all. But getting further dragged by bland one liners and intertwining subplots, makes it even worse. Eventually, in the wake of its competing concerns, it loses grip of its own direction and struggles to arrive to a decent endpoint. It also doesn't succeed tapping the utmost otential of its strong supports by not giving them enough material to work with. Jessica Alba and Samuel Jackson barely do something here, though there may be some little moments with their presence, that aren't really devoid of wit. Almost everything just falls flat, and the comic effort couldn't provide any aid, either, to redeem its sagging narrative."
Barely Lethal,"By the time the movie is already fast approaching its finale, it isn't any more surprise if Megan never came close to any of those heroines mentioned earlier, and it really disappoints that she never really came to be someone interesting, either. Well, you may want to blame that to her unconvincing chemistry (not saying there's any) with both her love interests, and a boring villain whose presence may have only really felt during the last action sequence of the movie."
Barely Lethal,"BARELY LETHAL wastes almost every promising attribute it has to live up to its overwhelming potential. In the end, it abandons what could be a unique take on the young espionage genre, and sets itself taking the leads of countless others it seems to emulate. The result is barely fulfilling."
Barely Lethal,"Megan (Steinfeld) trained in the dark arts of the assassin by Samuel L. Jackson's shadowy Hardman. But equally well-trained and even more ruthless is her nemesis Knox (Alba).
Megan (Steinfeld), raised in a secret-agent training facility by a Nick Fury type (Jackson), wants to be a normal teenager. She fakes her death to go to high school, posing as an exchange student. Her nemesis (Sophie Turner) pursues her, but Megan has more trouble with dating, parties and the lunchroom social strata than fighting off assassins. A cute, undemanding teen movie which lets Steinfeld be likable and Turner be hissable. It's predictable, but the dialogue is smart, Jackson and special guest villain Jessica Alba have fun and the mix of sweet, salty and tough is genuinely appealing."
Barely Lethal,Hardly groundbreaking but this high-school actioner ghosts by on its charm and sense of fun.
Barely Lethal,"Meagan (Hailee Steinfeld) is an orphan raised and trained by Hardman (Samuel L Jackson- no eye patch) to be an assassin. While on an assignment, Meagan grabs an opportunity to free herself from the group and become a normal high school student. Unfortunately for Meagan she has learned all she knows about High School from watching ""Mean Girls"" and ""90210."" She quickly doesn't fit in. She stumbles through High School until her past catches up with her."
Barely Lethal,"The premise is great. I was expecting a cross between ""Mean Girls,"" ""So Undercover"" and ""The Pacifier."" In a way it was, but wasn't well executed. The film could have been better. Hailee Steinfeld was not convincing in her role as a killer or High School student, which was ashamed since she had a great supporting cast. A movie you can like but not love."
Barely Lethal,Guide: 1 F bomb. No sex or nudity.
Barely Lethal,'BARELY LETHAL': Three Stars (Out of Five)
Barely Lethal,"An action-comedy flick about a teenage government assassin, who longs for a normal high school life; so she fakes her own death, and takes on a new identity, to get one. The movie stars Hailee Steinfeld, Sophie Turner, Dove Cameron, Thomas Mann, Toby Sebastian, Jessica Alba and Samuel L. Jackson. It was directed by Kyle Newman (the director of 'FANBOYS'), written by John D'Arco and released by A24 Films. I thought it was surprisingly fun, and entertaining, for such a seemingly generic teen comedy flick."
Barely Lethal,"Prescott Academy is a government school that trains special ops agents, to be assassins since birth. The best student in the program is Number 23 (Steinfeld). Number 23 is great at her job, but she passionately dreams of a normal teenage girl life. When she's suddenly given the chance to disappear, without notice, the agency assumes she's dead. She then takes on the identity of a fake high schooler, and enters a student exchange program; to be placed with a family. Number 23 soon finds out that high school life is even more difficult than special ops work!"
Barely Lethal,"The film is pretty simplistic; and it feels a lot like a TV movie (or TV show), in all honesty. That doesn't mean it's not entertaining though. Steinfeld is fantastic in the lead, and she really makes you feel for her character. There's also some great supporting turns (from Turner, Cameron, Jackson, etc.) and some cool extended cameos (from actors like Dan Fogler and Ron Huebel). The directing is adequate at best, and the action scenes definitely leave something to be desired, but it's still a fun movie."
Barely Lethal,Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/uINe8REiZw0
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"Shame on the directors, the purpose of this so-called movie is clearly politically motivated. The intention smells very bad a political propaganda reminding Goebbels. The movie presents the main non-fictional character Erdogan as a victim of a corruption case. North-Korea propaganda style. Many scenes are from political meeting where Erdogan shows an awful populism. Even the trailer is bad. Anyone can watch Erdogan lies on youtube instead of watching this movie. I would rate zero if that was possible. Keep your eyes away from that. Better to watch ""the interview"" which is at least a good comedy. Regards RK"
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"It is a badly acted, nothing but Turkish propoganda, and badly made excuse for a film. That is all that needs to be said."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"No one can be cleaned by throwing their crimes together to the other party. The Superhero Prime Minister and The Pope of Islam II.Elizabeth. They are new Marvel characters? Infidels worshiping lies, stop using religion."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"This movie is on Turkish Televisions everyday. Same fictional stories, same lies... Everyday we see internal mails from the employees of the close to government companies in which the managers threaten the employees to go to this movie and bring back the ticket if they want to keep their job. Turkey is passing through very rough times these days with its fascist government. This movie is trying to cover the billion dollars this government and their families stole (which are proved with many legal tapes, photos and voice recordings but darkened); trying to hide the innocent civilians they killed and trying to hide the evil leading the country. What is fortunate about this film for the Turkish people is that it is so bad. It is horrible and therefore no one will ever watch it in Turkey or abroad. It would have been a good movie with horrible lies but instead it is a bad movie with horrible lies..."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,Really awful. Don't waste your time. if even they give you money to watch it you will regret and you will never take back that hours from your life. You will suffer and suffer. There is no subject on that movie I was lucky I didn't pay because it was free I mean cinema was free. Can you imagine they put this movie free so. Ratings will be high. But I said even 10000 lira you will never take your hours back. I prefer to go and watch horse race or ice skating rather then this fully rubbish movie.i could sit and do nothing and still I will be more happy that hours than spend hours watching this thing. I mean who wrote this? Do they have a mind? Really? And how could you accept a role as a actor in such a ridiculous movie? Are you OK? Please tell me? Why did you do that to us? Why ?
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"Dear IMDb! please add a no star option cause if I give this film one star this will be an insult for the films which deserve one star. This is the worst and most disinformatic film I ever watched in my life. Please surf on facebook chatting with friends or what instead of watching this film cause it really really full of lyings and I and the people of Turkey is sure that this film is ordered by the current government of Turkey ruled by dictator Erdogan and the government even can put you in prison if you have a poll company and the resutl of you poll is against the gov. There are a lot of journalist are in prison in Turkey that there sine is to write against the gov. And there are hundereds of legal sound and video recording of Erdogan and his ministers that are particpiating in the Turkey's big corruption in the history, instead of answering for their corruption they put the polices in jail. and the government bought more than 90% of the media and even republic media are used actively against the people in Turkey and in this situation how can you believe this film that when asked the director about the film that is biased, he answered that I have chosen my side. Long Live Tolerance, dialogue and peace in the world."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,This was the awful movie I have ever watched in my life.Please tell me how it's possible to formally review a film titled K.O.Z.
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"Do not watch it. It is an absolute waste of time. It was also too boring. Also I paid 10 TL it was a waste of money. Than I heard that one of Turkish Political party giving tickets to its members for free. Highly political movie . It was produced in order to support the views of a political party. Also the the actors and actresses are not acting very well. I have never seen them before. Very small budget movie.This film is sure madness; a mess of epic proportions with so many odd features, amateur features, wooden acting, and loose ends that should technically derail the picture but, for some reason, do not. This is a charismatic film. One that doesn't allow itself to exercise more than what it is. It's silly, never boring, and embraces badness with a sense of lax, carefree fun."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"WARNING: curse words This is such a shitty movie for several reasons: * This movie is produced only to lie about AKP government's false policies, theft and murders. Such as; letting Iranian spies to occupy the intelligence agency of Turkey (MIT), hiding huge bribery (%10 of every business built in Turkey goes to the president of Turkey, RTE), and killing innocent people against their benefit - like the politician Muhsin Yazıcıoğlu, and so on."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"* This movie is produced with the money of AKP government. They gathered the money from the bribery %10 of everything, then pour it into a financial ""pool"". They support the newspapers, TV channels and a shitty movie like this with this money."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"* This movie is produced by an ideology, very similar to ISIS. They attack the very foundation of Islam by so-called representing it in this way of pressing, cursing, undermining, and killing - if necessary - all the people oppose to them."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"* ...the more I continue, the more I have to think of their rotten system. This makes me sick already."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"To sum up, this is not a movie. THIS IS JUST A BULLSHIT!"
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"The worst movie I've ever seen.. Don't waste your time. It is quite obvious that Turkish ruling government commissioned that movie. Shame on you the producers.. You are just the marketing channel of lying government. On the other hand, the cinematography of the movie is awful too. Bad acting, worse directing. Total waste of time. Instead of watching that crap, close your eyes or stare at an empty wall will do more benefit for the soul and mind.I am just wondering, if the actors knew that they were a part of a crap project. Ah, they should be aware right? They must have earned a lot of money to be a part of that propaganda."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"Kod Adı: KOZ gives us the Turkish government's version of its spectacular falling-out with Fethullah Gülen, an influential Islamic cleric who lives in Pennsylvania. Gülen was once a close ally of the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan but, over the past three years, relations have soured and in December 2014 a warrant was issued for his arrest on charges of ""leading a terrorist plot to seize power"". The story of the rift is complex, but the official government line is that Gülen is bent on destroying the Turkish state with his huge network of followers embedded in the police and judiciary: the so-called ""Parallel State""."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"This is rich fodder for political drama, further improved by lashings of artistic license. The key details of the Kod Adı: KOZ poster act as signposts – the silhouette with the unmistakable profile can only be Gülen, Big Ben represents the dark forces of supposed Gülen affiliates – the British and American intelligence services – and the tag line refers to the countless rumors and half-truths peddled by Turkish media on both sides of the fight. At the end of the film, viewers are under no illusion as to which version of the story the producers wish them to believe."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"KOZ sails dangerously close to libel but stops short by assigning fictional names to its characters. Instead, actors have been carefully chosen for their physical resemblances to the politicians, prosecutors and clerics they represent – sometimes, the resemblances are so uncanny as to suggest that these ""actors"" are in fact random men spotted somewhere by a casting agent and hauled off in triumph as the closest available body doubles."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"This theory is supported by the fact that many characters have been dubbed (badly) by marginally more talented off-screen actors, an otherwise inexplicable artistic choice. Either way, the resulting effect is surely to stoke credulity in the minds of audience members already receptive to the stories found in state media."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"Despite its poor rating, the film must be commended for its efforts to fit all the darkest political scandals of the past few years into two hours, each event inevitably portrayed as the work of Gülen, whatever its outcome."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"One example is the mysterious helicopter crash in 2009 which killed Muhsin Yazıcıoglu, the head of the nationalist-­Islamist Great Union Party. In the film, the crash is engineered by a Gülenist spy in revenge for Yazıcıoglu's refusal to fall in with Gülen's nefarious plans; the camera lingers several seconds too long on the bloodstained snow in the wake of the crash for maximum impact."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"Another episode dramatizes the arrest warrant issued in 2012 for Hakan Fidan, Erdogan's much-trusted head of the Turkish intelligence service. This Gülenist plot was, apparently, foiled by Erdogan himself, who heroically sent his personal military guard to save Fidan in an armed standoff outside secret intelligence headquarters."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"There isn't really much to say about this overly dumb and centrally propaganda set film except for it is god awful. It's stupidly incoherent, let alone not have any English subtitles to use. It also features some of the worst editing, cinematography and acting I've ever seen. This piece of nonsense propaganda for god knows what pretty much fails to do everything that propaganda should do; convince it's audience that the maker of such propaganda is the right person/ideology to follow."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"Code Name: K.O.Z is a movie that may go down in history as the worst film ever made. I give Turkey credit for it's ambitious attempt to make the worlds worst film, and I think they may have pulled it off."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"Actually even 1 star out of 10 is too much for this horrible film. The movie is a propaganda of tayyip erdogan, who I think is a dictator. The worst thing about the movie though, is not the bad acting, or for that matter the inane plot or over the top acting, it is the main subject itself. I am wondering why tayyip erdogan didn't act himself in the movie. Whoever made this film had a lot of cash, to bag all those actors/actresses to star in it. Now all of them wish they hadn't starred in it, I bet they all deny they are in it, it's that bad. Conclusion: there was only ever going to be one reason to watch this film and that was to see the Fat Slags, but, as they are not in the movie, there really is no reason to watch this film."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"This shameful movie is about government crimes. Which in fact is a murderer and a dictator. To hide their crimes, They say some people are betrayer. they also used deceased engineers for their own propaganda. People should not watch this movie to support human rights. Did you know this movie is screened for free to the audiences by government with tax payers money? Shame on anybody who watches this movie. If you want to support dictator governments and want to waste your money you may go to this movie. Please offer your friends that they should not watch this movie because of awful scenario. This movie really awful and my advice is to share this comment with your friends."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"I saw the movie, and it was great. Interesting, funny, enlightening - I loved it. On Reddit I saw that readers are calling on ""all atheists"" to give this movie a 1 Star rating - even if they haven't seen it. Don't believe the low rating its been getting. Very misleading. Cymen does an excellent job of putting together a family friendly film. It's not too preachy - it's actually anything but that. The characters are endearing. The jokes come at all the perfect times. My family got the biggest kick out of some of the humor. Way better than 99% of the garbage Hollywood puts out these days. I guarantee anyone rating it low has not actually seen it, and are simply haters."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"These kind of films consist of falsified news. They are the films of the state. So they just try to prevent the people from seeing the right things. Also the movie quality is really terrible. The players are really amateur. And nobody has watched it since it was showed in some places. Because everybody says that these movies are falsifying the people. As a result I don't recommend watching this film. It doesn't worth watching. We need more professional movies. Even if you're a talented filmmaker and you've made a movie that everyone is pretty much in love with, you're still not guaranteed an easy ride. Because it is not easy to make grate movies in these days."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"Well lets see here. I can't exactly remember how or why I ended up seeing this movie It is so crappy acting, stupid story, no plot, dumb half wits, If I had the choice I would live with herpes in exchange for this movie being totally wiped from my memory. Words cannot describe how completely idiotic and boring KOD Adi K.O.Z is. And oh if you thought the previews had anything to do with the movie think again. They do not. A lot of people in the movie theater walked out never to return. Right now some of city mayors give free ticket to make AKP propaganda but apparently it is not working at all. here I am thinking Well, There is hardly a plot, but old, cliché gimmicks to create a Enemy of the State. Does it work? Three? No. It does not. I have no idea how Cem Kurtoğlu, Hazım Körmükçü, Tolga Karel, Turgay Tanülkü,Remzi Evren got persuaded to participate in the film (MONEY). What can I say? Awful film. That had to be the single worst movie in the history of cinematography. It is not a movie, it's AGITATION FOR ELECTION."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever watched. It is an analogous to Adolf's ""Mein Kampf"". Turkish Prime Minister lives in a psychotic mood. So does his inner circle. Kleptocracy is a good word that describes the Turkish government today. Crony capitalism takes over market economy, and country's economy shrinks everyday. Erdogan tries to disguise the corruption scandals that were unearthed between 17-25 December, 2013. I heard that Turkish government subsidizes this movie, so that people can go to theaters and watch it for free. Overall, this movie depicts the shallow vision of the current corrupt and populist government."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"This movie is horrendous on so many levels - patronizing to Turkish people, incredibly bad plot and direction, the acting and dialogue is as comfortable as a dentist's visit. I suspect the whole thing is purely a desperate attempt by president to pander to uneducated poor supporter's (we call them sheep)reactionary tendencies.Either that, or it is just a giant ego trip for him. I had no preconceptions before I went to watch this, and left confused as to the amount of utter garbage wedged into what seemed like an eternity of boredom. Even worse, he is asking his moron supporters to bear false witness by skewing the votes here and on rotten tomatoes. Hypocritical? I'll let you decide."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"The movie is indisputably awful. I saw it in a theater when the tickets were made free due to its tremendous box office success until then. In fact, it would lead to a terrible stampede of art-sensitive, god-fearing, highly honorable people of Turkey if they insisted on their price policy because you know, art is for millet's (millet being the proudly ignorant portion of Turkish demographics) sake. Seriously, this thing is an insfult to the art. It sucks so hard that it creates a black hole in the history of cinema. And the worst thing is, it was produced by the very folks who came to power in Turkey hand in hand with those whom they blame now."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"It's so incredibly miserable that the unwitting statistical majority of Turkey thinks that the current government is ""somehow"" betrayed by a pseudo-religious community which the government had actually cooperated with from the very beginning. This movie is what you get when their interests eventually conflict. And here is a fun fact: the prime minister once claimed (after 12 years of power, access to any intelligence and government facilities) that he had just learned about the evil plans of this so-called parallel state to overthrow their ""legitimate"" government. Like all any propaganda stuff, this movie is intended to provide credibility to a crazy-ass set of lies that can only make sense in the political discourse. Anyway, that (not whether) the PM did not know about the activity of that so-called parallel structure was seriously debated and then accepted in Turkey and no one suspects anything. It sounds totally legit in Turkey. When a guy who has hours of voice records proving his corruption and lives in a mansion with an estimated number of 1150 rooms blames another guy for using the state for his respective interest, it totally makes sense in Turkey. Just try to imagine the logical processes involved."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"In my opinion,it is a masterpiece and unforgettable Turkish political near future story."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"When I saw this cult movie first I was so impressed during watching the movie because we have a real like this virus problem in our government system and we are suffering a lot of difficulties a as Turkish people. This radical religion group,it is called 'Gulen Cemaati'is so introvert and they are trying to lead all Turkish government bodies for forty years. Finally;"
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"I can proudly recommend this movie as a documentary about some extremist Religion groups, in Turkey!"
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,THE trolls of akp come here and write good rewievs for this bad movie. troll means they gain money to make the akp propaganda on internet. at every where they are make comments and paid for this. believe me the movie is worst movie on earth
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,Even 1 star is a lot for this movie. the producer says that it will break a record. he is right they break the record of the worst movie of world. this movie made by the order of the sultan tayyip erdoğan. they try to make the people believe in their lies by this kind of movie and with some shows on TV.
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,but modern people of my country don't believe their silly lies. even this movie is free no one watch it. i wish we will break their lies and our country will go to the shinny days. the worst thing a country can live is manage by the peoples which says only lies to their public.
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,you need to give a title to this movie. this title will be the most bad movie of all time.
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"After banning media to share clear corruption evidences, sending many journalist to jail and forcibly closing the cases without trial, Turkish government tries to convince voters using motion picture."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"Even though the scenario is absurd fantasy, production quality is above average. Seems like producers didn't make any budget cut, that deserves one star for the sake of Turkish cinema."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"Considering that the movie aims people who is not into any form of art, it's understandable that some theaters show it free. Due to it's low box-office results, it probably will be shown in most of national TV channels just before the national general elections in June 2015."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"In summary, it's a waste of time as a movie, but as a documentary it shows how politics can be shameless in order to keep their authority above public."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"This movie has been produced to direct public opinion to extinction of a civil society organization. It includes so many lies and conspiracy theories. Therefore, never waste your time to watch this awful movie. This movie has been produced to direct public opinion to extinction of a civil society organization.

Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"Just as Hitler's propaganda media. Turkish government and especially Erdogan to cover up ""theft"" that his propaganda film ! Shame on the directors, the purpose of this so-called movie is clearly politically motivated. The intention smells very bad a political propaganda reminding Goebbels. The movie presents the main non-fictional character Erdogan as a victim of a corruption case. North-Korea propaganda style. Many scenes are from political meeting where Erdogan shows an awful populism. Even the trailer is bad. Anyone can watch Erdogan lies on youtube instead of watching this movie. I would rate zero if that was possible. Keep your eyes away from that. Better to watch ""the interview"" which is at least a good comedy."
Kod Adi K.O.Z.,"This is an insult to the art of cinema. Characters are forced with incompetent interpretations. The scenario is written by a point of view that is representative of senseless state repression. To watch this ""non-aesthetic"" film until the end, you have to be mentally retarded or you need to be one of them. The film is a praise to oppression, which nowadays has shown its ugly face in what it claims to be the movie format.. Do not waste your time on this ridiculous propaganda film: The only gain is a total awkwardness. Even Joseph Goebbels had done –at least- better ones in the Nazi Germany. This will be remembered as a significant disgrace in the cinema culture if remembered at all. This film should be protested on the international platform. What a shame!"
The Duff,"The Duff is one of the best teen movies I have ever seen! It conveys this amazing message about learning to love yourself. Duff is just a word but the meaning is impactful. Mae Whitman is perfect as Bianca. She's witty and fun as she portrays a girl who is trying to make it through high school. Robbie Amell was also great as the love interest. He learned to fall for the real her.
Overall this movie will make you smile and laugh."
The Duff,"I never herd the term Duff before and I don't know if it exist in real culture, but it made for a humorous movie."
The Duff,"Bianca Piper is The Duff (Designated Ugly Fat Friend). Though it sounds very cruel when spelled out, abbreviated it just means your not as cool or as hot as the friends you hang around, and if your a teenage girl who was made aware of this by your idiot jock next store neighbor without previous knowledge that you were different from your herd, that could put you on a downward spiral."
The Duff,"This movie is just more proof that teenagers don't change (technology does and social media plays a very large part in this movie), which is why the movie seems formulated. I would not spoil anything if I told you how it ends so long as you have seen a teen comedy before."
The Duff,"I find the topic of the Duff fascinating. The character itself has been seen in every teen movie ever. It's always the main protagonist, the semi-cooler kid that wants the protagonist to party and the third wheel, that now has a name. For the first time in teen comedy history(I think) that third wheel got it's own flick and it turns out the Duff is funnier than the one liners we had it say over the course of time."
The Duff,Mae Whitman played the character with amusing results.
The Duff,I totally recommended seeing this film. highly enjoyable
The Duff,"In this tale which seems to take elements from Easy A and A Walk to Remember, Bianca (Mae Whitman) is told by her long-time neighbor and classmate, Wesley (Robbie Arnell) that she is the Designated Ugly Fat Friend (or DUFF for short)."
The Duff,"All Bianca wants is Toby, and will even help out Wesley to get that. In A Walk to Remember kind of format the unlikely friends become close and Toby is revealed to also believe in 'the duff' as he yearns for Jess and Casey, Bianca's friends, in the hopes that Bianca will hook him up."
The Duff,"It all comes to a head with a She's All That-esque moment close to the end of the film. It's a low budget film, and there's not an all-star cast. I really only recognize Mae Whitman from Scott Pilgrim, Ken Jeong, and Allison Janney. Everyone else here feels forgettable."
The Duff,"Although everyone fills out their roles and no one sticks out like a sore thumb, the acting is what sells the film. Mae has perfect timing for her on-the-button lines to finish off scenes. Mae is approachable, which makes Bianca approachable."
The Duff,"I did find some things in the film out of touch, however. In the early stages of the blossoming friendship, Bianca dances and makes a fool of herself with a mannequin at the store while Wesley does his best to be Gerard Butler in The Ugly Truth. It's revealed that Wesley's ex is filming the whole situation and then later, Bianca accuses Wesley. It pains me how cringeworthy it is. Anyone with half a brain would realize he wouldn't do that and it was impossible to do it without Bianca noticing. The way that the recording is done is not subtle either."
The Duff,"Aside from that there are sprinkles of comedic moments and quotes throughout the film. It's light-hearted and not raunchy like American Pie can be. It's got some taste and some brilliant jokes. Overall, it's worth a view and anyone who enjoys teen comedies with a bit of romance won't regret it."
The Duff,"The comedic movie, The Duff, is hilarious, relatable and worth watching. The film is about high-school senior Bianca, played by Mae Whitman, who finds out that she is the DUFF (Designated Ugly Fat Friend) of her attractive group of friends. Determined to change her DUFF image and impress her crush Toby, she turns to her popular neighbor Wesley Rush, played by Robbie Amell, to give her a complete makeover. Through her journey of transformation, she gains self confidence and shows the school that everybody is a DUFF."
The Duff,"Not only do I enjoy that the movie starts off fast, but I really like that it starts with a cool, graphic newspaper clip that explains high school and the different types of people in high school. Being a high school student myself, I was really surprised at how relatable the movie is, especially to today's generation of teenagers. It doesn't just portray the generic, stereotypical high school student that is so outdated. The movie has a lot of familiar celebrity stars that I enjoyed seeing. The performances by Mae Whitman, Robbie Amell, Allison Janney and Ken Jeong are especially hilarious and very entertaining."
The Duff,"The movie is hilarious, yet deep. Most comedy movies are really funny, yet pointless or lack an overall message. I laughed so often and even shed a tear in a heartfelt scene. The facial expressions are priceless and memorable. I respect this film for being extremely funny while also having a deep, motivational moral lesson and theme. I enjoyed the plot and moral of the story as much the comedy. The movie has a lot of references that are very comical. One example is an episode of the Simpsons that the movie shows. The movie also has really entertaining graphics that make the movie even more unique, some of this include labels and an interactive screen effect."
The Duff,"This film is one I will watch multiple times and tell my friends to watch, yet I do not recommend it as a family movie. The film may be inappropriate for children under the age of 13 due to inappropriate language and actions. I definitely recommend the movie for teenagers in high school, especially girls. I recommend the movie to ages between 13 and 18. I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars."
The Duff,"Without the chemistry btw its two leads, this movie would not have worked. Plus, the supporting cast of adults helped. This movie was better than it had any right to be."
The Duff,Whitman has always been a talented actress. I look forward to her eventually getting some truly meaty movie roles.
The Duff,"I enjoy watching teen movies to see what the young generation is up to. This movie gives the modern sensibility on final year high school students wading through the confusing labyrinth of romance and dating mingled with the vicissitudes of friendship. All with the absence of any help from adults, who generally are causing more stress than they are helping out. Feel good entertainment even if there is a little too much voice-over needed to explain what Bianca is going through."
The Duff,"Take a look around and survey your group of friends, are they all good looking? Then you might be the designated ugly fat friend, or the DUFF."
The Duff,"Bianca's life becomes undone when someone reveals to her that she is the DUFF to her prettier and more popular high school friends. Frustrated, she retaliates by instigating the status quo and social hierarchy at her school."
The Duff,"This comedy finds its laughs as Bianca, played by Mae Whitman, desperately tries to reinvent herself and overcome DUFF status. A chronic DUFF, she can't do it alone, and makes a deal with her neighbor Wesley (Robbie Amell) to undo the damage."
The Duff,"A fan of Mae Whitman, Robbie Amell is the clear star of this film. Playing an endearing jock without being a cliché is quite a feat and his performance is scene stealing without being a parody."
The Duff,"From that plot alone there is not much to the story within the high school film The Duff. The film injects an archetype antagonist, played by Bella Thorne, the most classic mean girl ever invented. This character's existence is solely responsible for the plot feasibly being stretched to feature film length – otherwise the DUFF would be relegated to a solitary episode plot line on a WB television series."
The Duff,"Though briefly marketed as the Mean Girls of the 2010's, it really is in an inferior class in comparison to the phenom that was (and is) Mean Girls. The writing, plot and direction are all ho-hum: funny enough for a one time watch with your girlfriends with popcorn, but that's about it."
The Duff,Please check out our website for FULL reviews of all the recent releases.
The Duff,"A teenage movie that obviously will play out one way or another depending on whether you like those or not. It's pretty witty and it has some genuine jokes in it (not to mention some very funny supporting cast to boot with). The story itself is as in many cases, very predictable. You know who the real ""target"" of affection is going to be."
The Duff,"But the movie is able to win one over, if you buy into the whole light heartiness of the movie. The movie as some before it is very self aware and there are many in jokes in this. It's also refreshing to see the main girl being a horror movie fan. It's also interesting to see how much PG-13 movies have evolved over the years and how much more is allowed to be said in them. All in all, a lot of fun"
The Duff,"Bianca (Mae Whitman), Casey (Bianca A. Santos) and Jess (Skyler Samuels) are three BFFs. Bianca is the smart one and at 14 minutes into the film she realizes she is a ""DUFF"" (Designated Ugly Fat Friend) which is certainly better than being a BUFF (Big Ugly Fat F@#$) although she doesn't like the role even though she is neither fat or ugly."
The Duff,"This changes Bianca's perspective on life, school, social standings, and her best friends. Bianca wants to go out with Toby Tucker (Nick Eversman) a boy who plays a guitar and has bangs. She gets the help of her childhood friend Wesley Rush (Robbie Amell), the high school jock who dates the hottest girl in the school (Bella Thorne) . Wesley needs help with chemistry which gives us the predictable formula results including the climax speech."
The Duff,The film is predictable from the title. It is teen oriented. DUFFs should love it.
The Duff,Guide: No real sex or nudity. Mom spouts an F-bomb near the end.
The Duff,Tbh when I saw the name of the film I presumed it was about a pregnant girl. Never the less it's a good enough high school comedy coming of age film. Nothing new or special but there's enough laughs to get by and it's a heartwarming enough story. Fits the bill for a quiet night in not paying complete attention with a takeaway perfectly.
The Duff,"Very cliched , high school teen comedy which surprisingly entertained me . the story has a freshness , the leads have actual chemistry , kind-of new presentation keeps you smiling ."
The Duff,"Fortunately the trailer teaches us what DUFF means because otherwise no one would know. It's that approachable guy in your group of friends who no one cares about but is useful for inter-group communications. You didn't ever know anyone like that? Me neither, go figure. But, as a film mechanic it works."
The Duff,Remember all that teen anxiety you used to have? Still got it? Yep me too. You're only comfortable with the people you know but how do you get to know someone new? If you're in touch with that feeling then this movie that explores awkward teenage romance will appeal.
The Duff,There are more laughs in this than the average teen movie. The characters are explored a bit more fully than in the average teen movie. It is a better than average teen movie.
The Duff,"The Duff is another movie in the expansive Teen RomCom, but it stands out for its charm, message, and how the plot is delivered. Is it perfect? No. However, Mae Whitman (Bianca) is charming throughout, Robbie Amell (Wesley) does good work, and Ken Jeong (Mr. Arthur) nails every scene he's in. Bianca Santos (Casey), Skyler Samuels (Jess), and Bella Thorne (Madison Morgan) play their roles effectively. Allison Janney (Dottie) also does well with her role."
The Duff,"Yes, the plot pushes towards the genre rather than harsh realism during certain points as expected. Those moments within the teen genre of films is always present, and shouldn't take away from the overall feel of the film. Overall, The Duff is fun."
The Duff,Real Score: 6.6
The Duff,"It's a fresh idea ,, new definitions and it's kinda purposeful which makes it a bit exciting .. not the type of comedy where you laugh your A$$ off ,, but it has more than a bunch of funny bits which made it fine in that area. Ken Jeong appearance was one of the few of scenes that intrigued me to keep on watching the movie, Hilarious man.. to be fair ,, this project would look so much better as a TV movie or probably as a series on CBS, and it could hit huge success, but the idea of series based on these type of stories is not really new on TV (like ""Awkward"" 6 seasons so far on MTV which is a success),, the plot seemed entangled but it went toward a clear goals .. the writing looked okay ,, tight in some parts but still it didn't help much to cover some holes in the production as there were a couple of still scenes in the mid of the movie."
The Duff,"As for the cast ,, it was well picked .. again Ken Jeong in the beginning of the movie ,, he was really funny ,, the girl from ""parenthood"" ;) Mae Whitman she has flown up high to be really good funny gal and all the other girls as well were fine,, Chris Wylde was hilarious in the end of the movie :D ,, Robbie Amell really good acting all popular and careless .. ""you were nerdy on fire in the flash"" :D :D,, adding the lovable Allison Janney i think all of that crew made the movie a bit more funny and well it helped out with the rating."
The Duff,"Overall,, it is fresh enjoyable movie .. with a funny bits from another perspective and not forgetting to shine a light on cyber bullying problem.. so it is a recommended."
The Duff,The premise of the movie might be a little cliche. But it definitely brings back the 90s movie vibe where things are simple yet heart warming. You might also get an epiphany after the movie! A duff? Who me? Omg!
The Duff,"Hmm. I gave this movie an eight... probably because the topic synchronizes with the current age and mind sets I'm in. The comedy, the acting, and especially the casting choices contributed to the eight. For now I won't talk about the plot, because they'll *definitely* give out spoilers, so I'll just chat about some of the stand out casts."
The Duff,"Stand at front and center is our lead lady, Bianca Piper, played by Mae Whitman. It was fun having having Whitman as the ""Ugly- Duckling-Turned-Swan"" character(we all saw that coming; the Chinese translation of this movie was ""The Springtime for the unattractive beauties""), but I gotta say that in a certain sense, Whitman was a questionable choice. True, the casting made her a character that's average-looking, kinda round-shaped, in order to make her two companions stand out, but even with all her figure and no makeups, isn't she still, like, the prettiest girl in that school? I mean, she's smart, funny, makeup-free, a total brainiac... Maybe it's just me being preferential - have been liking her since her minor role in Independence Day, but her talents really did brought us amazement - From Scott Pilgrim to Parenthood, this lady really keeps surprising us in both acting and comedic performances. In short, to me, it's more like Samuels and Santos brings Whitman's character out."
The Duff,"The male lead was one of the main reasons I started following this movie. Wesley Rush, played by Robbie ""Firestorm"" Amell. I'm not kidding - he's really like a firestorm these days, both his professional and personal lives are quite awesome. Ever since his days as Stephen Jameson on The Tomorrow People he bilped on my radar and never dropped since. Then his Firestorm role was amazing - especially so during that The Flash episode when he teamed up with his real-life cousin Stephen, who plays Green Arrow on Arrow. Before that he was in smaller movies like Picture This, Struck by Lightning, and even a guest starring on Pretty Little Liars. Since that he seems to have started his intro into the big leagues. Hope to see more of his performances in more renounced movies in the future."
The Duff,"Next is the movie's main antagonist, Madison Morgan, played by Bella Thorne. This is not her first significant role as a self-centered lady jerk already - her first checkpoint as a really awesome movie antagonist was during her days on Alexander and the Terrible... Day. Her portrayal as the movie b*tch shows that she can be amazing at literally any roles. Besides, bad guys get the best lines."
The Duff,"Skyler Samuels and Bianca A. Santos plays the left and right wing in Bianca's holy trinity group of girls. Not much about Santos(this movie marks Santos' first blip on my radar), but Samuels was great. Before this movie I watched Helicopter Mom, with her as female lead, and she stunned me. Totally the possible legit next-gen acting gem. She got the looks, she got the skills and she got all tools of the trades. The group looks really inseparable any ways - Samuels portrayed the looks, Santos the strength, and Whitman the wisdom."
The Duff,"And finally in the end part - which means the most important one - Mr. Arthur, played by Ken Jeong. I gotta say, watching Jeong here was really neat - he changed his outfits, and his portrayal here was phenomenal - best one in the movie. Truth be told, his role here; not only did he successfully portrayed a legitimately wise teacher - the wisdom, the care, the just, the calm... but the main reason I said ""best one in the movie"" was because nothing but his role here successfully and completely washed off the smudge he caused in my mind with that idiotic Asian role in Transformers: Dark of the Moon. I mean, him in a Michael Bay film(no offence to the director - he still makes neat movies), drinking Shuhua Milk and saying it out loud(WTF?), then that scene at the toilet with Shia LaBeouf... jeez. Admit it, this one Ken Jeong role can totally clean up that ""Deep Wang, Deep Wang, Deep Wang..."" mess ten times."
The Duff,"Alright, Think that's about all the significant ones. This movie is very fun to watch, so if you get a chance, try not to hesitate."
The Duff,"Attempts made at this genre have turned my stomach in the past.
But it has also been breakthrough ground for many an actor, writer and director."
The Duff,"In this day and age, originality or even a decent attempt at reinvigorating a tired story arc is rare but I was relieved and pleasantly surprised by this film."
The Duff,"Mae Whitman and Robbie Amell have a commanding and heartwarming chemistry I honestly thought would never again be achieved in this age of shallow and genre over-kill. They gave a sincerity to the film that was its compelling foundation and saving grace, especially as they were given the term ""Duff"" to reckon with and make an endearing learning curve. Their interactions were a joy to watch and made for many an honest laugh which won this film comedic credibility."
The Duff,"It also has Allison Janney. It also has Ken Jeong. It also has Romany Malco.
So, that's win for me too."
The Duff,It lost a point in not fleshing out Bianca's best friends. Maybe this was done on purpose but their dialogue lacked substance which I found bizarre amidst the rest of the film's promising and developed aspects.
The Duff,"It does an admirable job in handling the awkward and the heart of the matter. It reflects on points and issues that could well be causing self-doubt among teens out there, indeed the world in general, especially in this social media-crazed society, and the film does so with a humour and timing that was welcome and unexpected."
The Duff,"A definite recommend for any movie night. It's light, highly watchable and soon becomes a favourite."
The Duff,"The DUFF is quite entertaining and has a really nice poignant message. The film captures life, I mean the characters, and I'm mostly referring to Wesley (Robbie Amell) and Bianca (Mae Whitman), are realistic, humanized. I got a weird sense that I was watching people I knew and not a stereotypical film version of them. The movie has that documentary feel to it and it's due to how the leads portrayed their characters and how easy it is to relate to them."
The Duff,"The only real disappointment I have with the movie is that I thought it would be funnier. It's still a comedy but it's a little more serious than I expected. Watching the trailer I thought that I would laugh a hell of a lot more, specially when you look at the established comedic cast in it. Whitman and Amell do have good comedic timing and The DUFF is fairly funny but the quality of the jokes are not as high as I hopped they would be."
The Duff,"The story is intelligent, insightful, and kind of funny but it's still very predictable. The DUFF is on the edge of being great but it's not."
The Duff,@wornoutspines
The Duff,"The captivating ""Pygmalion"" comedy ""The DUFF"" revitalizes the standard-issue, romantic, high school, makeover movie. No, I haven't read Kentucky-native Kody Keplinger's 2010 novel that she wrote while she attended high school. Nevertheless, freshman director Ari Sandel and ""Bandslam"" scenarist Josh A. Cagan appear to have infused their adaptation of Keplinger's yarn with the wit, charm, and sophistication reminiscent of classics such as John Hughes' ""The Breakfast Club"" (1985) and Amy Heckerling's ""Clueless"" (1995). Most makeover comedies are so lame they are mediocre. Prime examples include 1987's ""Can't Buy Me Love"" and 1999's ""She's All That."" Moreover, the superlative makeover movie parody ""Not Another Teen Movie"" (2001) subjected the genre to devastating ridicule. Although ""The DUFF"" appropriates most of the usual conventions and clichés, the characters emerge as more interesting, the predicaments more stimulating, and the humor more imaginative. While our sympathetic but iconoclastic senior class heroine is negotiating the complex social order maze, ""The DUFF"" compounds her problems, pitting her against cyber-bullies who exploit the social media technology to insult, humiliate, and destroy her because she represents a threat. No, this frivolous, PG-13 rated, frolic doesn't plumb the appalling depths of ""Disconnect"" (2012) where callous cyber bullies drove a sensitive teen to commit suicide. Comparatively, our heroine packs considerably more pluck than the unfortunate ""Disconnect"" protagonist, and she survives everything with which her ruthless adversaries assault her."
The Duff,"Like most teen movies in a high school setting, this clever comedy categorizes its characters by archetypes. ""The DUFF"" assembles the traditional gallery of crude egotistical jocks, bitchy babe princesses, and oblivious adults--whether they are administrators, instructors, or parents. Sandel and Cagan orchestrate the action around the most prominent high school happening: prom. Of course, graduation constitutes the other landmark event, but prom overshadows graduation. Primarily, prom generates far greater opportunities for dramatic conflict than congregations in caps and gowns. As in most high school sagas, teenagers are searching desperately for their place in the social pecking order. While their parents and peers are manipulating them like marionettes from behind the scenes, these struggling teens have to muster the nerve to assert themselves as individuals and break free of those fetters. All makeover movies, whether good or bad, are ranked by how challenging the obstacle course is, and if the teens can triumph. Naturally, our resourceful heroine achieves her goal, but she has to sidestep the slings and arrows of her treacherous enemies along the way."
The Duff,"The acronym DUFF that doubles as the title for Sandel's first film stands for 'designated ugly fat friend.' If for no other reason, ""The DUFF"" has carved a niche out for itself in teen makeover movie history because it originated this term. Bianca Piper (Mae Whitman of ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"") doesn't live to loiter in the limelight. An honor roll scholar, she writes for the campus newspaper, dresses as if she were homeless, and watches cult horror chillers like Lucio Fulci's ""Zombie."" Bianca's two best friends are aspiring fashion designer Jess (Skyler Samuels of ""Furry Vengeance"") and gorgeous but geeky Internet nerd Casey (Bianca A. Santos of ""Ouija""), who can do anything with a computer. Not surprisingly, these two dolls are drop-dead gorgeous, while our ugly duckling heroine dresses beneath their status. Bianca's life-long, next door neighbor is football team captain Wesley (Robbie Amell of TV's ""The Tomorrow People"") who dreams about dating Jess. He approaches Bianca one day to recruit her as his go-between. At this point in her high school career, Bianca has never heard the term DUFF. Moreover, she cringes with surprise and horror at being pigeonholed into such an unflattering category. Wesley explains that DUFFs exist everywhere. At lunch, he points out examples of both guys and girls at lunch taking refuge from the violence."
The Duff,"No sooner has Bianca learned about her deplorable status than she resolves not only to alter her lifestyle but also eliminate her friends. Actually, neither Jess nor Casey has ever taken advantage of Bianca as a DUFF. Nevertheless, our hot-headed heroine doesn't see things objectively enough at the moment. Meantime, resident 'mean girl' drama queen Madison (Bella Thorne of ""Blended""), who has had an on-again, off-again relationship with Wesley, has decided to renew their romance. Things come to a boil when Wesley's poor chemistry grades jeopardize his status as captain of the high school football team. Simultaneously, Bianca marvels at the ease with which Wesley navigates the social order. Bianca cuts a deal with Wesley. She will tutor Wesley in chemistry, if he will show her how to attract the attention of her dream guy. Naturally, green-eyed Madison has kept an eye on Wesley and Bianca from afar, and she plots Bianca's demise if she doesn't leave her Wesley alone. Madison's best friend shoots a reality video journal of Madison's life, and Madison assigns her to maintain stealth surveillance on Wesley and Bianca. Ironically, Bianca wasn't trying to seduce Wesley. Instead, Bianca has had a crush on a laid-back, acoustical guitarist, Toby (Nick Eversman of ""Wild""), but she cannot utter more than two words when they encounter each other on campus."
The Duff,"Indeed, ""The DUFF"" is predictable, particularly if you've seen as many teen makeover movies as I have, but top-notch casting, charismatic characters, and suspenseful situations elevate this comedy above the standard stuff. Mae Whitman reminded me of the ultimate 1990's DUFF character: Janeane Garofalo, who co-starred with Uma Thurman in ""The Truth About Cats and Dogs."" Whitman's fascination with horror movies is also reminiscent of Ellen Page from ""Juno."" Bianca provides a running, voice-over narration, enlivened with commentary similar to Emma Stone's comments in ""Easy A."" Happily, Whitman and co-star Robbie Amell generate showers of sparks, and they look like they enjoyed sharing their scenes as teacher and student. The funniest scene depicts Bianca trying on apparel and making out with a mannequin that resembles her dream date Toby. Altogether, ""The DUFF qualifies as an easy-B."
The Duff,Warning : This Review Contains Spoilers
The Duff,"Wonderfully witty and whimsical movie that Mae Whitman carries and steals the show as Bianca a clumsy yet sassy and funny nerdy, girl next-door character who follows the right path focusing on school and friends not style or guys and her chemistry works well with Wes (Robbie Arnell) the popular jock who is struggling with science."
The Duff,"Another great film initiative of her best friends Casey (Bianca A Santos) and Jess (Skyler Samuels) are her friends despite her looks and style. However, Wes clumsily tells her what she was clueless about and really was not the case of her being the 'designated ugly fat friend.' That spurred enough incentive for Bianca to leave her friends and get Wes to help her get a new look and dating dos and don'ts in order to get the wannabe musician Toby (Nick Eversman) to like her."
The Duff,Yet as any popular girl has a posse of spies like Blair Waldorf. Here the Queen Bee Madison is Wes's ex (Bella Thorne) with a trashier dream of reality TV and dating older men as opposed to Chuck Bass and Columbia. But for now Madison is on and off with Toby and her reputation will be tarnished if her ex was seen with a geek and people speculated they're dating.
The Duff,"This movie is definitely not ""She's All That"" but it's good enough for this generation and anyone for that matter. It's a timeless issue of popularity, love, friendship, etc. with a few changes in television and technology references and style. There is a lot of mentions of hash-tags and videos going viral and what not on screen which shows how bullying is nonstop today. Also, another issue again for instance, 'Gossip Girl' or most teen romantic comedies if you exclude excess technology such as, 'Mean Girls' or 'Never Been Kissed.'"
The Duff,Not quite realistic but beautiful and shows how foolish and mean youth can be. This is as close to reality a comedy should be otherwise it would not be. The script is snappy and serious yet silly which teaches us that we should not take life too seriously just live in the now and be as present as we could be. This movie teaches a crucial life lesson that confidence is key not popularity but education and real relationships not a fake million friends. Timeless lesson must be put into consideration. At the end of the day the word duff does not define a person.
The Duff,I have rewatched this film countless times because when I'm in a funk and feel like I'm just so different from everyone else this film brings my mood up and makes me feel that it's okay to be different. I would highly recommend this film to those who love romantic comedies that have a little extra character development.
The Duff,This is not a movie.
The Duff,This is a science experiment.
The Duff,"The object is to establish once and for all whether films like Heathers, Easy A, and Mean Girls (among others) were actually quality productions -- or whether there is just something so magically interesting about High School romcoms that ANYBODY with a camera and a script they recently crayoned on the back of a menu can make a successful film...?"
The Duff,"Well, the results are in."
The Duff,"Turns out you actually need a good story, a good script, a good director and charismatic actors to pull off a decent film in this genre."
The Duff,Which pretty much eliminates this entry from the competition as it seems to have none of the above.
The Duff,"(Although Whitman and Amell both show potential, and one suspects with better material they COULD shine)"
The Duff,I have reviewed a lot of films but I cannot easily recall one where every opportunity for entertainment was either sabotaged or missed completely.
The Duff,"The film actually panders to its audience, throwing around internet tradenames as if, by their sheer volume, they can elevate the viewing experience."
The Duff,"At the 30 minute mark, the audience is asked to believe that two teens engaged in picking outfits in local department store could possibly ""miss"" the fact that they are being video'd by a third teen half-hidden behind a rack of dresses....? In Film School they explain that these are the sorts of ""subliminal"" turnoffs which make the viewer uncomfortable on a subconscious level, even if the conscious mind misses it."
The Duff,"Have no fear -- in this film the script repeats the same trope at the 1:00 mark where the same third party secretly videos the same couple, only this time in the woods."
The Duff,Watta script!
The Duff,"Does the term ""creatively bankrupt"" strike a chord?"
The Duff,"The ending tries, and that is the most I can say about it."
The Duff,"If anything it tries too hard, and in other reviews I have talked about the filmic dangers of putting too much ""message"" in your movie."
The Duff,"However in the case of this film, by the time you get to the end -- assuming you can -- the film-makers have made so many other mistakes that ""too much message"" is the least of their worries."
The Duff,"Teen comedies are the best! I have always high school comedies such as Sixteen Candles (1984), The Breakfast Club (1985), American Pie (1999), Bring It On (2000), Mean Girls (2004), and Superbad (2007). I was really exciting about seeing The DUFF, as there as hasn't been a whole lot of teen comedies recently. This movie follows Bianca Piper (played by Mae Whitman), a high school senior who's learns she has been labeled the DUFF, short for Designated Ugly Fat Friend, by her classmates. The DUFF is basically the friend who is least prettiest in a group. Bianca decides she must reinvent herself, and then turn the tables on snobby hot-girl Madison Morgan (Bella Thorne) to restructure the school's society."
The Duff,"This film reminded me a lot of Mean Girls, it deals with similar themes of high school popularity and spreading rumors. While its not quite on the level of Mean Girls, its still very clever and very original. Mae Whitman and Robbie Amell (who plays the football jock who Bianca gets help for advice) have some good comedic chemistry. Bella Thorne also plays an interesting role, as one of Bianca's classmates who is very snobby and judgmental, and tries to throw her under the bus. She is a lot like Rachel McAdam's character from Mean Girls. I did find it kinda weird for Mae Whitman and Bella Thorne to be playing classmates as Whitman is nine years older than Thorne. I also loved Ken Jeong, who plays Bianca's teacher."
The Duff,"Overall, I was satisfied with this movie, I had its funny scene here and there, especially when Mae Whitman and Robbie Amell is on screen. This film will definitely please a fair amount of teenagers and probably adults like."
The Duff,"When Bianca, a high school student finds out that she is a duff, a friend picked up by some hot girls as an ambassador between them and those who want to talk to them, she makes a deal with the school's popular athlete and her forever neighbor Wes to make her stop being the duff. The story line is the same old story about girl wanting to change and boy being so desperate for increasing his grades, that agrees to transform her. However in Duff there is a twist. Bianca, although wiling to change, she learns to appreciate herself the way she is. That was something original in the plot, but the rest was just the well known high school drama (with technology being used very cleverly here). The performances were really good, especially the girl who played Bianca was exceptional, really owning the role and being just enough funny and just enough melodramatic as it was needed. So I give Duff 6 out of 10."
The Duff,"The hurt on Bianca's face is appropriate the day she is informed by an otherwise good friend that her place in the high school pecking order is to be ""The DUFF"" - The Designated Ugly Fat Friend, meaning that she is the friend that other girls keep around to make themselves look more attractive. ""It's not like a big deal, every group has one"" he says, ""You know the one who doesn't look as good , thus making their friends look better."" Placed in such a mean-spirited and unfair distinction fills Bianca, reasonably, with anger and resentment. It is therefore perfectly reasonable that the guy who gives her this information gets a drink thrown in his face."
The Duff,"The bitter heartlessness behind such a distinction is an ungainly weight tied around the neck of an otherwise cute teen comedy. The DUFF is not a wretched or dismissive movie, but a cute comedy burdened by a repugnant ideology that it never overcomes or knows what to do with. The idea is that everyone is, or knows, a DUFF but the movie isn't about proving that you are beyond such a cruel distinction but that it's okay to embrace such a label with pride. It's a flawed reasoning that kills any potential that this movie has."
The Duff,"Our hero is Bianca Piper (Mae Whitman) a cute high school teenager who is somewhat removed from the social circles of those around her because she doesn't give in to whatever vapid trendy nonsense that her schoolmates happen to latch themselves onto. She dresses in flannel and overalls and does whatever she pleases whether it's popular or not – in other words, she an individual. She's a pretty girl with a bright and charming personality. Anyone would be lucky to have her as a friend."
The Duff,"Therein lies the problem right away. Bianca is neither fat, nor ugly, and the people who encourage this label are certainly not friends. Bianca is a person of her own making, an individual who seems to have spent a great deal of time building herself up outside of what her classmates are doing. Apparently that's not enough as her childhood friend Wes (Robbie Amell, cousin to Stephen) tells her one night at a party. Visibly hurt (see above) she dismisses his hateful label and goes on about her life – great. What is not so great is what she does next. She asks Wes for help in changing her image thereby casting off the DUFF label. Of course, by all measure of reason, she should have told him to drop dead, but instead she gives up her individuality and tries being something she's not."
The Duff,"The problem is, it goes south fast. While on a shopping spree one of the mean girls from school takes a video of Bianca playfully humping a mannequin in a department store and doing various other things that might be unwise in public. The video goes viral and Bianca finds herself the target of cyber-bullying and a laughing stock at school. And the rest of the movie is her attempts to overcome such humiliation and win the heart of the guy she likes (not Wes)."
The Duff,"What is most uncomfortable about this movie is that the DUFF designation exists at all. It is explained to Bianca that she is a DUFF, but instead of casting away such a label, she attempts to embrace it. It's a dysfunctional idealism that the movie doesn't really know what to do with, and it's strapped to a character who wouldn't fit such a hateful label in the first place. Bianca is a wonderful human being, a charming girl with a bright personality and a personal style that is all her own."
The Duff,"Bianca is played in a charming performance by Mae Whitman, a former child actor who has a bold and wonderful screen presence that I hope to see in a better movie. She is burdened by a plot that pulls her down, forcing her into a march through the standard beats of all high school comedies. Better teen movies have come along lately that have freed their characters from the confines of convention and let their characters be people, see The Perks of Being a Wallflower, The Spectacular Now, Juno, Dazed and Confused. Those movies are about people, not plotting. No one in those movies is a DUFF, and no one would be put up with being labeled as one."
Horrible Bosses 2,"I watched both 'Horrible Bosses' films back to back and it's clear that the first movie is the better of the two. 'Horrible Bosses 2' has its moments but lacks ideas and the originality of the first film. The guys are a lot more stupid in the sequel, they reminded me a lot of the Hangover trio. Whether that was deliberate or not I don't know, but they weren't that dumb in the first film."
Horrible Bosses 2,"By the standards of the average comedy movie, it's not bad. I laughed a few times, which is more than can be said about a lot of comedy sequels. Like in the first film, Aniston and Sudeikis are the highlight for me. Both are brilliant in their roles. 'Horrible Bosses 2' isn't as bad as some would have you believe, but there's a clear lack of ideas here."
Horrible Bosses 2,"Horrible Bosses 2 is a great movie with a well written storyline and an outstanding comedic cast.The first Horrible Bosses is certainly better,but this sequel this totally holds up and delivers many very entertaining and laugh out loud scenes.The three leads are still in great form the second time around and you can tell that Bateman,Sudekis and Day are all great friends,and they are joined by a star studded supporting cast that includes Christoph Waltz,Chris Pine,Jennifer Aniston,Jamie Foxx,Kevin Spacey and Breaking Bad's Jonathan Banks.Pine would have to be my favourite out of the supporting cast,his character had the best dialogue and he was surprisingly great at comedy.The movie thankfully dosen't follow the same premise as the first,which is something that a lot of comedy movies do and I was very grateful that they took a very different approach from the first.Packed with tons of laughs and a great cast,I would definitely recommend Horrible Bosses 2 to fans of the first and to anyone looking for a good comedy."
Horrible Bosses 2,"After they fail to get an investment from a very successful business man,Nick,Kurt and Dale decide to kidnap his son to receive the money they need to run the business."
Horrible Bosses 2,Best Performance: Jason Sudekis Worst Performance: Lindsay Sloane
Horrible Bosses 2,'HORRIBLE BOSSES 2': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)
Horrible Bosses 2,"Sequel to the 2011 hit comedy flick 'HORRIBLE BOSSES', which was about three friends who team together to try to murder their bosses. This time the buddies plot to kidnap the adult son of a rich businessman, who conned them out of their own business dreams. All of the main cast, of the original film, is back for this installment (except Colin Farrell, who's character died in the first movie); including Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis, Charlie Day, Jennifer Aniston, Jamie Foxx, Kevin Spacey and Lindsay Sloane. They're joined this time around by Chris Pine and Christoph Waltz. It was directed by Sean Anders and written by Anders and John Morris (along with John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein). Anders and Morris are the same team that wrote other popular comedy flicks like 'SEX DRIVE' (which Anders also directed) and 'SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE'; they also co-wrote 'HOT TUB TIME MACHINE', 'WE'RE THE MILLERS' and 'DUMB AND DUMBER TO' (I'm a big fan of theirs). I wasn't a fan of the original 'HORRIBLE BOSSES' but I absolutely love this sequel!"
Horrible Bosses 2,"Nick Hendricks (Bateman), Dale Arbus (Day), and Kurt Buckman (Sudeikis) have decided to start their own business together; instead of having to continue to answer to the horrible bosses of other companies. They've come up with a unique shower head invention, they call 'Shower Buddy', and think they've attracted the interest of a rich investor and his son, named Bert (Waltz) and Rex Hanson (Pine). Bert promises the trio that he'll buy 100,000 units from them but after they take out a $500,000 loan, and make the product, he backs out of the deal; he then plans to buy all their shower heads, at a discounted foreclosure price, to sell himself. In order to get their money back Nick, Dale and Kurt decide they're going to kidnap Rex and ask Bert for the $500.000, they lost, in ransom. Things, of course, don't go as they planned."
Horrible Bosses 2,"I liked the idea of the original movie but just didn't find it to be that funny; I thought a lot of the jokes fell flat (despite an awesome cast) and didn't think it seemed very inspired (especially considering the great premise and great cast). This installment gets everything right that the first film got wrong. First of all it's hilarious, from beginning to end, thanks in large part to the directing of Anders and the clever writing team of Anders and Morris. The jokes rarely miss this time around and it's got a pretty clever caper storyline, and an awesome car chase climax, to boot! The film's success is also thanks largely to the outstanding cast, that seems like they're having a lot more fun this time; you can see it in the bloopers (in the end credits) and you can also just feel it in the movie (the whole way through). This is comedy done right; much better than the original!"
Horrible Bosses 2,Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/bPyUBLHQdWM
Horrible Bosses 2,For heavens sake it is a slapstick comedy and contains enough funny scenes to achieve its purpose.
Horrible Bosses 2,Cant imagine what some people expect and the people that say they didn't laugh until the end credits well I actually feel sorry for you. It must be depressing to be unable to laugh at childish adult humour.
Horrible Bosses 2,I personally found the film enjoyable but I must admit I am a big child at heart and see comedy films as they as supposed to be.
Horrible Bosses 2,Is this is greatest film of the year NO but it is far from being the worst film of the year.
Horrible Bosses 2,I will most likely watch this again with my nephew who has the same sense of humour as myself and sure he will love the film.
Horrible Bosses 2,Personally I loved both the first movie and this one. Although the storyline is a little predictable it definitely is funny and it's great to see everyone from the first movie in the second movie with the exception of Colin Farrell. (Obviously)
Horrible Bosses 2,"I love Jason Sudekis, Charlie Day and Jason Bateman together and I'd definitely watch another movie with these three. Is this sequel Oscar worthy? No, but it is definitely funny and a pretty good sequel."
Horrible Bosses 2,"A sequel to the decent Horrible Bosses, 'Horrible Bosses 2' is a much superior & much funnier sequel, that delivers above expectations. I laughed, laughed & laughed!"
Horrible Bosses 2,"'Horrible Bosses 2' Synopsis: Dale, Kurt and Nick decide to start their own business but things don't go as planned because of a slick investor, prompting the trio to pull off a harebrained and misguided kidnapping scheme."
Horrible Bosses 2,"'Horrible Bosses 2' gets it right, as there are hardly any major minuses here. Sure, the second-hour, where our ill-fated protagonists plan to execute their plan, could've been shorter, with a better climax. But otherwise, this sequel is a riot. The sequences, one after the other, especially the ones with Horrible Bosses Veterans (Portrayed superbly by Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx & Jennifer Aniston), bring the house down!"
Horrible Bosses 2,"Sean Anders & John Morris's Screenplay is brisk, hilarious & interesting. The goings-on barely offer dull moments. Anders Direction, also, is appropriately done. Cinematography is fine. Editing is good."
Horrible Bosses 2,"Performance-Wise: Jason Bateman, one of the finest actors in the block, delivers a truly committed performance, yet again! Charlie Day is first-rate, he contributes to some of the film's funniest bits enormously. Jason Sudeikis supports very well. Christoph Waltz deserved more scope, nonetheless, he's passable. Chris Pine is fantastic. He enacts the comedic baddie to perfection."
Horrible Bosses 2,"On the whole, 'Horrible Bosses 2' is one great laugh! Go, have fun!"
Horrible Bosses 2,"The main three from the first film return for another case of zany misadventures. Nick(Jason Bateman), Kurt(Jason Sudeikis) and Dale(Charlie Day) who are idiots, not even smart enough to realize that people think there idiots, they make stupid attempts to gain respect. The three decide to into business for themselves coming up with a shower buddy, just when they think there making it big, there investor(Christoph Waltz) backs out of the deal, the three decide to cut there losses and kidnap the annoying son(Chris Pine) of there investor, but will this plan go well?"
Horrible Bosses 2,"Bateman, Sudeikis,and Day are still great in comic form, the three have such funny chemistry, and the zany misadventure they get themselves into is always fun to watch. Jennifer Aniston and Jamie Fox reprising there roles from the first one are also fun. But Chris Pine who looks like he's having too much fun here, really overdoes it in a few scenes. And Christoph Waltz is not giving much to do. I don't think Horrible Bosses is one of those films I'm not sure even needed a sequel, but still was entertaining and funny, almost has good. Kevin Spacey is alright the scenes he's in."
Horrible Bosses 2,"Horrible Bosses was 2011's best comedy and one of the very best that year too. It is awesome like The Hangover movies. When I heard about a sequel being made, I was all over it. Ready to see an awesome flick as a confidant to the first, the movie exceeded my expectations to the point where I thought it exceeded the first. There is ten times more danger, more complexity, and the guys actually ARE guilty of the crime they commit. Nick, Dale, and Kurt invest in a new kind of shower head and are approached by Chris Pine. He makes them an offer they disagree with, then his father (Waltz) makes them an offer they do agree with. After making their own factory and hiring many new employees, Waltz pulls the plug leaving them in debt. They then plot to kidnap Pine for ransom, but he catches them in the act and actually helps them construct a brilliant ransom. So as you can see, the three main men are guilty of kidnapping (even though Pine stopped them), fraud, and ransom. But as characters cool like The Wolfpack from The Hangover movies, you don't care how guilty they are and you just want them in the clear. There are some predictable parts that the director knew was predictable, so extreme hilarity and unpredictability from grounds around it make the predictable bit apathetic, which it good. The abundance of danger and things at stake make this movie easily more suspenseful than the first. Personally, I found this funnier than the first by just a little bit. Each character is funnier and the perilous situations I mentioned are as hilarious as they are deadly. Jennifer Aniston, Jamie Foxx, and Kevin Spacey also make returns as crazier people they were in the first."
Horrible Bosses 2,4/4
Horrible Bosses 2,"I honestly thought it was way better than the first. This movie is ridiculous, the whole scenario is ridiculous which is what makes it funny. The three main actors have the best synergy. Three morons who try to kidnap a millionaire's son for ransom, you can only imagine the chaos that ensues. I really enjoyed it, but the humour is a little silly so it's not for all. You either going to like it or hate it, more specifically Charlie Day. A lot of people complain about his voice, but personally I thought he was one of the funniest. One thing is for sure, this movie does not deserve a 6. It's well above 6 and should easily be ranking 7-7.5 score."
Horrible Bosses 2,"A continuation of the Horrible Bosses series, this second in the series hits a bit more about the complexity of striking out on your own. The three amigos in Nick Hendricks, Kurt Buckman, and Dale Arbus take a risk in establishing their brand of shower heads and seek a stake in the business world. What they discover is that is much more of doggie dog world than they expected. Has a large well known cast from Kevin Spacey, Jaimie Foxx, and Christoph Waltz. Jennifer Aniston is the nastiest I have seen in this film and does push the cougar sex craze angel to the limits. As the trio strike out on their own, they soon discover they need plan b if they want to be able to compete in the world of business. This plan B is not perfect but helps them find a path to being their own bosses."
Horrible Bosses 2,"Horrible Bosses 2 continues with the story of Nick Hendricks(Jason Bateman), Kurt Buckman(Jason Sudeikis) & Dale Arbus(Charlie Day). After the events of the first film Nick, Kurt & Dale have quit their respective jobs & are now their own bosses. They invent a Shower Buddy. This invention consists of a built-in shower gel & shampoo in the shower head. They look for investors. A businessman named Bert Hanson(Christoph Waltz) shows interest in the trio's product. He agrees to buy their product for a lot of money. However, he later double crosses them. This prompts Nick, Kurt & Dale to plan a kidnapping involving Hanson's son, Rex Hanson(Chris Pine)."
Horrible Bosses 2,"Horrible Bosses 2 is freaking hilarious! I was laughing non-stop from start to finish. At first, I was skeptical when I learned that they were making a sequel to Horrible Bosses(2011). However, all my doubts were laid to rest when I started watching the movie. Every single joke in this film had me guffawing uncontrollably. There were some scenes that were so funny that I was struggling to catch my breath! The cast works really well together & you can tell that they had a whale of a time shooting this movie. Jason Bateman is great as Nick Hendricks. Jason Sudeikis is brilliant as Kurt Buckman. Charlie Day is outstanding as Dale Arbus. Jennifer Aniston is spectacular as Dr. Julia Harris, D.D.S. Kevin Spacey is hysterical in his short but important role as Dave Harken. Jamie Foxx is mind blowing as Dean ""MF"" Jones. Chris Pine is awesome as Rex Hanson. Christoph Waltz is good as Bert Hanson. Jonathan Banks & Lindsay Sloane are impressive as Detective Hatcher & Stacy Arbus respectively. If you liked Horrible Bosses then you will love Horrible Bosses 2. This film stays true to the spirit of the original & improves upon it. Go, watch it right away & laugh till your sides hurt!"
Horrible Bosses 2,"With sequels you are never sure what you're going to get. Most of the times they are just not good, sometimes it's the same movie as the first one, and sometimes they are just as good or even better. I thought this one was at the same level as the first one. I had fun watching it. Almost all the actors made me laugh, sometimes more sometimes less. Some characters are less humorous in their role, because the character is just stupid, but nevertheless this movie is fun to watch. I think all the actors are great in this movie, and the story might not be the best story ever but I was not expecting a great story anyway when it's a laid back comedy. Fun to watch with some stupid jokes as well."
Horrible Bosses 2,"In this sequel, the guys (Bateman, Jason Sudeikis, Dale Arbus) have invented the Shower Buddy, which shampoos your hair and washes you at once. The son of a huge catalog company, Rex Hanson (Chris Pine) calls them in and makes an offer - a one time fee and their company takes over the product. The guys refuse, then find out the offer was for $3 million and is now off the table."
Horrible Bosses 2,"Then Rex's dad (Christoph Waltz) enters the office, orders 100,000 units, and gives them the name of his bank so they can obtain a loan and get started. After they have manufactured the units, daddy totally screws them over, as he planned to all along. The guys find themselves out $500,000 and have lost rights to their product. It's time to take their usual ineffectual action. And this time, they have an unlikely ally."
Horrible Bosses 2,"The usual suspects are back - Jennifer Aniston. Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx, and they're all very good. The humor in this film seemed even raunchier than the first, unappreciated by yours truly, which is why I hate these comedies."
Horrible Bosses 2,"Chris Pine was hilarious, and Christoph Waltz was excellent as well."
Horrible Bosses 2,The best part? The outtakes during the closing credits.
Horrible Bosses 2,"It's always interesting to see how comedy series go about their sequels. 'The Hangover Part 2' took the route of making an almost exact replica of the original, simply in another country and was almost universally panned for it (although personally I still quite enjoyed it). Then with their third entry in the series they went almost the entirely opposite direction (to the point where there wasn't even a hangover in the film) and got a more positive response. Go figure. Horrible Bosses 2 seems to have changed things up just enough to keep people satisfied while still staying very true to the format that made the original so good."
Horrible Bosses 2,"The main three have tremendous chemistry, there's no doubt about it. Every scene is so much fun. Then you throw in the brilliant cameos from Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey, Chris Pine, Christoph Waltz, Jamie Foxx (the best of the lot) etc. and you have a very enjoyable film. It's actually a very smart movie and could easily have been tweaked here and there to make a reasonable thriller out of it. And that's what drives each scene (much like the previously mention 'The Hangover') and keeps the humour fresh and driven rather than forced. A very good sequel all up and I look forward to the third edition I'm sure is just around the corner."
Horrible Bosses 2,"I don't normally review films as plenty of people manage to put across a good enough review. I feel so angry about how bad this film is that I really need to warn you about how bad it is. It's not funny and it's boring to add insult to injury. It does have a couple of funny moments in, but for a comedy film, that's nowhere near enough. The acting is bad, the script is bad, the plot is even worse. I don't need to say any more as you'll either watch it anyway or have watched it and are looking for reviews to prove you're not alone in hating this film. This is the second worse film I've seen this year behind Godzilla. I'm even doubting that the first film was as funny as I remember."
Horrible Bosses 2,"It may only be slightly less funny than the original but Horrible Bosses 2 is still matches the original in overall quality, delivering a really funny sequel that puts a nice spin on the formula of the first one whilst still having the mean spirited humour (toned down though)."
Horrible Bosses 2,"The central trio are just as good as before and the constant bickering is thankfully still funny with Jason Bateman playing it mostly straight, Charlie Day being pure chaos and Jason Sudeikis being the middle ground between the two."
Horrible Bosses 2,"Sean Anders' direction is really good, fitting in naturally with the tone and style established by Seth Gordon whilst adding a lot more technical flair. The soundtrack is great and adds a lot to the overall sense of fun with its knowingly ridiculous song choices."
Horrible Bosses 2,"I thought the first Horrible Bosses film was good-a bit unpolished in places but basically a good & watchable funny movie. The sequel is actually an awful movie. The first film was flirting with tackiness but never really 'took the plunge' into true tackiness-but this one does. Unless you like jokes about gay men licking other gay mens asses: don't see this film. I think there is some stuff you just shouldn't say in a movie-apparently the producers of this potato don't feel that way. Also the interactions between the three main characters was so hard to watch in many cases in this sequel it made you crave watching a film on brain surgery-it was that crappy. Fortunately the cinema where I saw it took pity on the fact it was such a horrible movie and allowed me to get a refund after I departed the film after about 20 minutes worth of its brain shattering crap. I don't think there has ever been a time where they have made so many nothing movies before and I'm not talking about films like The Interview. Many of the supposedly funny/entertaining films that are more recent are just stupidity like this film. Just avoid it. The thing about that is the spate of dogs that they have been releasing are probably gong to coast some cinemas their businesses. I was the only person at this movie so when I left it was playing to an empty room, and that was in the early evening on a shopping night-the time when most people will take the time to see something at their local cinema."
Horrible Bosses 2,"So much fun the comedy is on point and everything stays entertaining! Horrible Bosses 1 is one of my favorite comedies, it's rare that the sequel is just as good as original. This movie makes me laugh out loud which is magnificent I don't laugh enough in general. The soundtrack is so good goes well with everything, scenes are smooth, genuine friends, amazing how right Harper was right about the 3 main guys they kinda are morons yet so much fun throughout. I love this movie for what it is!"
Horrible Bosses 2,"I enjoyed the first movie, it was fresh, it was funny! But then they made a second, with a poor storyline, and a so annoying Charlie Day, it literally made me want to rip my face off. His voice was so squeaky, and forever on-going, I finished that film with a god awful headache. I know the three of them are meant to make bad decisions constantly because it's part of the humor of the show, but for me, all it was, was extremely exhausting, and it was mainly to do with Charlie Cox being the squeaky, childish idiot, who can't keep his mouth shut. Seriously, if you want a headache after watching a movie, watch this, but if not, steer way clear because this movie stinks."
Horrible Bosses 2,"""Horrible Bosses 2"" starts off rocky, but in the end I laughed so hard and so often that it could easily see past that. The setup, like I said is pretty rough, but it leads into some good stuff, so bear with me. Between the first movie and this one, Nick (Jason Bateman), Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) and Dale (Charlie Day) have quit their jobs and started their own company. When a millionaire (Christoph Waltz) ends up putting them in a no-win situation, these three idiots get caught up in a kidnap and ransom scheme involving the man's son (Chris Pine)."
Horrible Bosses 2,"I can't reiterate enough how rough the beginning of this movie was. From the moment I saw the poster for this movie, I was wondering how they even set up a ""Horrible Bosses 2"". Weren't all of the issues from first movie totally resolved? How would these characters end up with bosses that were as bad, if not worse than the ones from the first film? That's why the weakest part of the movie is the beginning. They basically have to jump through these weird hoops to give us a new story. Once you get past that, and I certainly did, it is filled to the brim with laughs."
Horrible Bosses 2,"There were not just one or two big laughs during this movie. I laughed consistently out loud because although I've come to kind of love the heroes in these movies, they are total idiots. That's what works with this movie. I'm sure there would be easier ways, if you applied real-world logic to this plot, for them to get out of the pickles they get themselves in. These guys are not bright enough to do this though. They think they learned their lessons from what happened in the first movie, and I suppose in a way they have. That doesn't mean they're any smarter though. This time around they have a slew of wholly new idiotic actions and decisions to make and they will do them over and over. That means you will get a joke, and it'll be funny and then out of the blue they will repeat that joke, right when you had forgotten about it and it becomes twice as funny. What I found surprising is that because the characters in this movie are so stupid, the plot becomes completely unpredictable. Oh you know that things are going to go wrong, but with these three, who knew what it was going to be? I think my favourite thing, above all is that this film is similar to the first one, but it isn't a rehash. It's just kind of inevitable at this point that these three idiots (and I really mean idiots; these guys couldn't willingly pull off a murder between the three of them in the first movie, and they barely got away with not getting all three of themselves killed) are going to get themselves in trouble. The trouble this time might have to deal with another horrible boss, but it's not the same exact situation where all three of them have to deal with a bad person and they decide to kill each other's bosses. This movie really is a sequel. It's the further adventures of Nick, Kurt and Dale. I was glad to be along for the ride."
Horrible Bosses 2,"You can tell that everyone making this film was having a great time, and that it's infectious. The laughs come in quickly and consistently (and there are some outtakes during the credits to ensure you leave with a smile), there's great chemistry between all of the actors, the additions to this ""universe"" are a lot of fun, and they manage to make a sequel that will bring back some of the favourite elements from the first movie too. I didn't know what to expect out of ""Horrible Bosses 2"" and I really had a terrific time. I can't wait to watch the first movie again because knowing that these guys will have further adventures will probably make it even better. I'd be excited to watch it again because I was laughing so often that I know I missed out on a lot of the jokes. (Preview Screening on the big screen, November 20, 2014)"
Horrible Bosses 2,"Whilst not to the standards of it's predecessor, Horrible Bosses 2 is still better than most comedy films released in the same period. Keeping the same dynamic that made the first successful, each character's traits are emphasised another notch, whether it be stupidity, sexualisation or frustration. It makes the trio a little less relatable, and causes the dialogue to feel a little more scripted, rather than the improvisation that worked so well previously."
Horrible Bosses 2,"Despite that, this film is still lots of fun, as the failed killers turn their attention to kidnapping. Secondary characters from the first film return and in many ways make more of an impact, plus those added are distinct enough to keep things interesting."
Horrible Bosses 2,"The best stuff comes from the three leads spontaneously interacting with one another, and overall this is another fun, light-hearted film that is very much directed to a more mature audeince."
Horrible Bosses 2,"Hollywood's strategy of wringing every last ounce of life out of a successful idea via sequels, prequels, spin-offs and the ""partification"" of films has been discussed to death. At this point I'm almost as tired of having that discussion as I am seeing the subject at hand play out in real life, over and over again. It is with this mindset that, upon seeing the trailer for Horrible Bosses 2 for the first time, I loudly sighed in my theater seat and thought to myself, ""Why the hell are they doing this?"" And despite the actual answer being EASY MONEY, after actually seeing Horrible Bosses 2, I can honestly make a case that maybe – just maybe – these people actually wanted to get together again and make a funny movie for the sake of comedy. Exhibit A: The jokes are solid and, in most cases, funnier than the first film's. Part of that is a result of just letting a joke breathe and flourish naturally via timing and delivery. One gag in particular regarding the use of walkie-talkies nearly made me choke on my popcorn specifically because of how well it was executed through dialog alone. The first Horrible Bosses was more comparable to The Hangover films in that a group of white guys get in over their head and endure insane circumstances, each one more outlandish than the one before it. This time around, while we're still very much in the Hangover spirit of storytelling (I use that term in the loosest of senses), the film is much more reliant upon the comedic chemistry between our three leading men. That leads me to"
Horrible Bosses 2,"Exhibit B: This cast is simply fantastic. Reprising their roles as Nick (Jason Bateman) the straight man, Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) the womanizer, and Dale (Charlie Day) the fool, the three stars of this film bounce lines off one another like bumper cars to increasingly hilarious effect. Bateman shines brightest and that speaks volumes on his talent considering he's been playing variations of this role for nearly his entire career without the shtick showing any signs of wear – at least as far as this film is concerned. Sudeikis and Day get to play human cartoon characters the entire film and it simply just works. Also back is Jamie Foxx as the criminal consigliere, ""Motherf***er Jones."" While this character did nothing for me the first go-round, this time I find myself enjoying his dimwitted power plays and Big Gulp inflected sit- downs. Jennifer Aniston also returns as her sex-addicted dentist from the first film and gets to appear in the funniest scene of Horrible Bosses 2. Newcomers Chris Pine and Christoph Waltz also bring a welcome exaggerated Big Business brass ballsiness element to the film's central plot that just makes the story that much more relevant. Speaking of the plot"
Horrible Bosses 2,"Exhibit C: This story is conducive to comedy as well as being socially relevant. Nick, Kurt and Dale have created a product that Christoph Waltz agrees to help manufacture. Once the order has been completed, Waltz's character then cancels the order in a strategy that will allow him to purchase the product at pennies on the dollar once our three heroes have to claim bankruptcy. In a climate where we are mistrusting of the unscrupulous 1%, this plot has a sort of resonance that hits home with modern movie goers. I'm also fairly certain that more folks can relate to being screwed over by their boss (or the boss's conniving underling) than they can to their mega-hot co-worker trying to seduce them against their will. Basically, this film corrects every issue I had with the first one in that it unifies the protagonists motivations with the audience's desire for them to stick it to the man. It reaches across the aisle and finds a middle ground we can all agree on – and then it amps it up to mach speed by way of kidnap, hostage taking and much worse."
Horrible Bosses 2,"With all this praise you might think I'm ready to call this a modern comedy classic. I'm not. Horrible Bosses 2 has problems. It's not shy to rely on gross-out gags, it has no shame in reprising jokes from the first film (albeit sparingly so), and it might as well have been directed by Apple CEO Tim Cook because, as Erik Walkuski of ScreenCrush noted in a tweet, Horrible Bosses 2 looks like it was filmed on an iPhone. That is to say there is no personality to the look of the film. It just is. While that's not a major concern for a comedy, it does leave a bit to be desired in the aesthetics department."
Horrible Bosses 2,"I present my case that Horrible Bosses 2 is a win for everyone. Hollywood will make a nice payday while being able to say, ""See! People want more of the same"" without a hint of irony to be found. Audiences will get to laugh for a straight 110 minutes in the company of characters they already know they like spending time with based on the success of the first film. And although this could mean ""more of the same"" is all we're ever going to get, I'd like to put a positive spin on things and hope that maybe someone behind the scenes is paying attention. Maybe, just maybe, someone will pick up on the fact that this film is better than the first because it's actually just better in every sense of the word. Probably not though. *a football hits me in the groin and a laugh track explodes from an unknown dimension*"
Horrible Bosses 2,"If you like annoying babble with characters talking over each other, you'll love HB 2. I found the relentless cross talk terribly annoying... mostly because it occur so often in the sequel."
Horrible Bosses 2,Charlie Day as Dale Arbus was totally annoying.
Horrible Bosses 2,"The movie has moments of comedy, but many of the scenes are just ruined by annoying babbling."
Horrible Bosses 2,"For me, Chris Pine was the standout actor and character. Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston and Jamie Fox all do a good job with their characters too."
Horrible Bosses 2,"I was really looking forward to HB 2, as I liked the first movie. I felt the plot had many holes in it and there was many actions that just seemed to be put into the script just for a giggle - with no follow- up or follow-through."
Horrible Bosses 2,Normally I try to make possible reviews rarely do I make negative reviews but for this film it has left me no choice.
Horrible Bosses 2,"Now the first Horrible Bosses did have some moments that make you go ""Really""? but it was still enjoyable but this one Oh My God it is just uninspiring. What were they thinking for this!?"
Horrible Bosses 2,I mean the jokes in this film are so awful and pretty much disrespectful the comedy is just plain awful it just feels the writers didn't care as long as it made money.
Horrible Bosses 2,Well the cast from the first film reprise their roles for the film it is just not enough to save the film from burning in the movie eternal fire pits it deserves to burn in.
Horrible Bosses 2,The plot for the film is just so stupid that it makes the film unbearable to even consider paying attention to it.
Horrible Bosses 2,"And don't get me started on the acting, the cast couldn't find an performance in this film with both hands and a map all I can say is that they must have gotten a big paycheck to star in this film, they perform so badly that they should have consider making this a direct to video release because I've seen TV movies with better acting then this film because they just act so awful that you would want to scream."
Horrible Bosses 2,Horrible Bosses 2 should have been called Awful Writing and Performance because I pretty much lost respect for those who started in this movie.
Horrible Bosses 2,If you have any love for films and comedy films you will avoid this film at all cost it isn't even bad comedy it Terrible Comedy.
Horrible Bosses 2,I wish this site allow for 0 ratings because this film isn't even worth one star
Horrible Bosses 2,So I have no choice but to give Horrible Bosses 2 a 1 out of 10. Trust me you'll be happy if you never watch this film
Horrible Bosses 2,"The trailer made me want to see this film, though I was not about to do so with no frame of reference. So, I was sure to watch Horrible Bosses beforehand, an enjoyable but underwhelming film. This sequel, however, is one of the funniest films I have ever seen and certainly to my mind the most outstanding example of a sequel improving on its predecessor."
Horrible Bosses 2,"The film is cleverly plotted with refreshing comedic ideas. It also references the first film in welcomed ways. This time around the trio can just go for it with a great script and the experience of the 2011 film. I found Charlie Day's Dale Arbus annoyingly over the top at times in the original, but in this sequel everyone is on point with real comedic chemistry."
Horrible Bosses 2,"Christoph Waltz continues to flourish with his supporting role. Chris Pine is great in his role. Jamie Foxx and Kevin Spacey successfully reprise their roles as expected. I do not normally think of myself as a Jennifer Aniston fan, but she is indispensably good in both films. I was also happy to see Jonathan Banks, whom I remember well for heavies he played in the '80s."
Horrible Bosses 2,It was very well received in my crowded theater.
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"Amsterdam 1982, the recession has hit hard. A group of friends and builders are down on their luck and are refused a bank loan. It's spokesman Cor van Hout proposes an outrageous plan, to kidnap local millionaire, the successful Freddy Heineken. The group test the waters by carrying out a bank heist, then carry out the daring dead, taking Heineken and his driver, holding them hostage, issuing a huge ransom demand. Cracks appear in their unit, and their family lives suffer too."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"Most of the positives surround Hopkins, he gives a masterclass in acting, his performance is understated and yet believable. Some of the best scenes in the movie revolve around his demands for Chinese food, books, Schubert etc, it's very random but enjoyable."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,One entertaining moment when the team realise they've left the ransom note in a photocopier nearby.
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"Sadly the film didn't keep my attention, it's the kind of film you'll need a crossword or Sudoku puzzle. Unfortunately it is quite boring, the plot was a good one, I think possibly had some humour been added to it that may have helped, as a thriller it just doesn't work, there's no tension or drama caused, you never feel at any point that the gang truly mean business."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"As for the accents, some of them wanted to go Dutch, some of them didn't, it felt inconsistent."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"It could have been so good. I've only seen a trailer for the Dutch production, but that seems to have the atmosphere that was needed, this production is sadly a week old unwanted glass of Heineken, FLAT."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,5/10
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,The events of 30 November 1983 when Freddy Heineken was kidnapped in Amsterdam are well-documented. It resulted in the highest paid ransom up to that point in history.
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"The movie is a bit disconcerting because it features an all-star cast of British actors, and a former Brit as Mr Heineken, but overall did not detract too much from the story when you finally realize they are all Dutch."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"The group of five men are depicted as needing money, they have what seems like a legitimate business but need a bank loan. Unable to secure that they resort to crime. The plan is to kidnap Freddy Heineken, hold him for ransom, and expel all their financial woes."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"Anthony Hopkins, former Brit and now American citizen, is very effective as Freddy Heineken. As history witnesses the men were able to get the money, split it up, and get away. But only for a short time. Even though two of them managed to get to France, and one to Paraguay, they all ended serving prison terms. Not all of the money was recovered."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"There is nothing very special about this movie, mainly interesting because of its historical account. The crooks are depicted as mostly bumbling, they had no real strategy for the aftermath of the kidnapping and ransom delivery."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,Anthony Hopkins lends his name and histrionic talents to uplift an otherwise pedestrian real- life crime thriller KIDNAPPING MR. HEINEKEN. Without his presence this would be just another direct-to-video feature of European origin.
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"Don't get me wrong -I've been a huge fan of European-made caper and action movies since childhood, growing up watching innumerable dubbed -into-English low-budget imports on TV via syndication packages back in the '60s. At the high end, Jules Dassin's RIFIFI remains the unbeatable greatest caper movie of all time, and the various big-budget, in-joke titles like the original and update series of OCEAN'S ELEVEN are watchable. But give ma a silly Brad Harris-Tony Kendall intl. co-production and I'm in heaven."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"With a weak script by William Brookfield, based on Peter de Vries' reportage and book about the beer company magnate's 1982 kidnapping, this film turns out to be lacking in entertainment value. The criminals, a rag-tag group of businessmen/slackers who turn to crime when their unreasonable application for a business loan is turned down, are simply an uninteresting bunch and their reluctance to resort to violence (lethal or otherwise) is morally laudable but leads to dullness - the picture has no sex and no real violence, hardly suitable for today's audiences. And it lacks humor, not even of the Disney or OVER-THE-HILL GANG puerile variety."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"Only interesting structural note (which ultimately backfires) is the script's purist approach whereby every scene is presented from the criminals' point-of-view. In a kidnapping story the viewer is used to time-honored clichés regarding the police (or FBI or Interpol) and the victim's family and associates -what they are doing to get Heineken back alive and catch the baddies. But here we have none of this, only scenes about the kidnappers and their apprehension at getting caught. This novel structure (cops only appear sans dialog to pursue or make arrests) violates Hitchcock's famous dictum about suspense -all we get are surprises because we (like the kidnappers) are narratively left in the dark. We never see the net closing in on them, apart from a few red herrings based solely on the criminals' own paranoia."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"Jim Sturgess as head kidnapper Cor, a family man with pregnant wife who inexplicably throws all that away to become a fugitive merely longing to return home from his Paris hideout, is empathetic and acts well enough, but can hardly carry a film. The role called for an A-list name, perhaps his supporting co-star Sam Worthington, miscast as Cor's brother-in-law, written as a hothead but unconvincingly played by Sam who the viewer is used to seeing (after AVATAR) as a leading man."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"Hopkins in as brief a screen time as won Judi Dench an Oscar for Shakespeare IN LOVE, easily dominates the film with his brief but pungent & idiosyncratic monologues -he gets to speak unanswered because the hooded kidnappers don't want to respond to him verbally at all. You can see the wheels turning in Hopkins' head as he cleverly tries to get into the heads of his adversaries and casting him was a bold stroke (probably the reason Worthington signed on to an unpromising project at this stage in his career)."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"I did not like the camera-work and editing of the movie, especially during action & chase scenes such as a boat vs. cars sequence on Amsterdam's canals after the boys had robbed a bank delivery van to raise capital for their big Heineken snatch score. And the musical score is horrendous, sounding like a distant copy of those classic 1970s British action movie scores, notably echo-chamber brilliance for Roy Budd's GET CARTER (a movie by Mike Hodges that was among my very favorite films when I saw it several times in 1971 in first-run)."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"Regarding film's factual basis, that issue is irrelevant to me - I love both LAWRENCE OF ARABIA and BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI regardless of either's allegiance to the original text. HEINEKEN merely proves that a purely fictional movie has more leeway to be entertaining and fanciful - the details here are pretty mundane, the degree of jeopardy for Heineken and his also-kidnapped chauffeur being minimal. The actual bank heist and people snatching are over in seconds, robbing the viewer of the fun which crime caper movies (TOPKAPI, RIFIFI) can provide, even in a silly one like Connery/Zeta-Jones' ENTRAPMENT. And the decision to make HEINEKEN the usual faux-British movie with all principal roles given British accents and speaking English (why not Dutch accents, as Holland with Derek De Lint, Rutger Hauer and endless beautiful actresses has the best English-speaking talent in all of Continental Europe) hurts its real-life credibility. I half expected a certain class of characters here to speak Cockney like Hollywood movies used to do in the 1930s for working-class characters in German or Russian set stories."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"'Kidnapping Freddy Heineken' is a story about a gang of Dutch crooks who decide that holding one of Holland's wealthiest businessmen for ransom will be a fast-track to easy money. It's hardly an inspiring premise, but the thing that makes it – slightly – better than the rest, is that it's based on a true story."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"If you check out the literature online about it, you'll see that – surprise, surprise – liberties have been taken with the plot, but, from what I can gather, it is reasonably faithful – if you excuse the obvious parts which have been 'Hollywooded up' to speed the story up. The second plus point is Anthony Hopkins, who plays the titular millionaire. Always a good performance from 'Sir Tony.' Unfortunately, he's not in it as much as most of us would probably like. The main story focuses on the criminals, half of which are pretty bland, although one is played by Sam Worthington and another does have a family who features prominently, fleshing out his character a bit more. You may have to wait about forty-five minutes before we meet Hopkins though."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"The film does its best to get us to empathise with the criminals and, for the most part, it sort of succeeds. We can see that they're the down-on-their-luck sorts who are only really after the money, but, at the end of the day, they are criminals, so – deep down – we're pretty much waiting for them to get their comeuppance."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"If you're interested in the history of the case, it's probably best to read one of the books. Granted, I haven't, but I'm happy to settle for the big screen adaptation. Yeah, it passes the time – it's nothing special and I probably won't remember it in a year or so, but it kept me just about entertained enough while I was watching it."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"""You know what your doing is completely stupid, unless you pull it off. In which case it could be completely brilliant."" When a group of friends are denied a loan they are desperate for money. They come up with a plan to kidnap the founder of the Heineken beer company (Hopkins) and ask for a large ransom in exchange. What starts off as a great idea, little by little begins to unravel. This movie is based on a true story and this is something I knew nothing about. The movie itself started off good and I was interested but the longer it went on the less interested I seemed to get. I'm not sure why, the acting was good and the interactions between the kidnappers was entertaining but this was another movie that I had a hard time staying focused on. It really seemed to stumble toward the end and this was another movie that I was thankful that it wasn't longer. Overall, I wondered why a movie with this cast didn't have a wider release, after watching it I can see why. I disappointingly give this a C."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"""Kidnapping Freddie Heineken"" is just as its title tells us. It is about how a group of five down-and-out young men who pulled off the kidnapping of a noted beer magnate Freddy Heineken in 1983. They were able to demand 35M Dutch guilders (about 16M Euros), the biggest ransom ever paid for a kidnap victim. Will their sudden windfall help them with their most cherished dreams?"
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"This British-Dutch production gathered Hollywood stars to portray the characters in this crime drama. For the kidnappers, they have gathered a group of twenty-something actors who had previously top-billed a number of films on their own already. For the victim, the producers went all out and got a revered senior Oscar-winning actor to play him."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"Jim Sturgess is an actor who deserves to break into the big time. He is a chameleon able to disappear into any role he plays. Since his big break in ""Across the Universe"" in 2007, he has been consistently turning in remarkable performances in films like ""21"", ""Upside Down"", and ""Cloud Atlas"". In this film, he plays the charismatic Cor van Hout, the mastermind behind the Heineken kidnapping. He was able to show more acting depth than the rest of the younger cast, especially since he was also given a pregnant girlfriend to worry about."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"Sam Worthington is an Australian actor who came on strong in 2009 to 2010 with the lead roles in major productions like ""Avatar"" and ""Clash of the Titans"". His career never really progressed too much in subsequent films after his auspicious Hollywood debut. His star power always felt secondary to the special effects of his big films. In this smaller, quieter, character-driven film, Worthington's screen presence as Willem Holleeder is obviously weaker than those of his co-stars Sturgess and Kwanten."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"Ryan Kwanten is another Australian actor. He broke into mainstream consciousness as a regular cast member of the HBO vampire-themed TV series ""True Blood"" which ran for seven seasons before concluding last year. Kwanten also registers strong on the big screen with punkish charm as Cat Boellaard, who owned the boat house where they hid Heineken."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,Those scenes where Sir Anthony Hopkins would be talking to the kidnappers individually were the best of all. The tension in those scenes were so thick with Hopkins chewing into their conscience with his masterful performance as Freddy Heineken. The scenes were definitely the saving moments for this film. Too bad these were only few and far between.
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"On paper, this sounded like it could be a very interesting crime film. Five complete amateurs in crime dream big, kidnap a multimillionaire and earn a huge payback and then some. How did they pull it off? How did they treat their victim who was their goldmine? What was the aftermath of their actions? Unfortunately, the script by William Brookfield, adapted from the books by Dutch investigative reporter Peter de Vries, was more turgid than exciting. The uneven direction by Daniel Alfredson also failed to make the weak script fly."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"The setting is obviously Amsterdam, but the kidnappers talked and behaved like they were London punks. The abduction scene per se was not shot with much cinematic imagination nor verve. Everything was done so seriously, with hardly any sense of humor (except maybe for the Bang Bang chicken scene). The filmmakers were not able to create any moments to really remember it by. In fact, this movie even felt tedious despite its brevity. 5/10."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"All the elements are here but some things are not working. The actors give their all, but are a little cliched. I got the sense there was too much dialogue. The story itself is exciting enough, but I guess I've been spoiled by movies about Baader Meinhof and Gomorrah, where the leads were charismatic and the danger more pronounced, and the vision of Europe had more depth and colour. Call me crazy but I thought the lighting and the film stock used were running counter to the intrigue. It all seemed a little too high contrast indoors, and not enough contrast for the night scenes. And the film stock used seemed to lack a little definition and could have been, well, less ordinary, more big screen. There were plenty of locations, but I still got the sense that all the action was taking place in a rather dull, single suburb. Then again, maybe in reality it did. On the plus side, I did think the depiction of the early 1980s was pretty good. I also thought the use of Sir Anthony Hopkins to be a redeeming stroke of genius. Of all the actors his sparse yet crucial use was a joy to behold, and lifted the entire movie. I thought Sam Worthington good too, and to be fair he somehow outshone his immediate friend and unofficial leader of the group, being a darker character and definitely better groomed. That's what I found frustrating about the movie, little things like the lead's uncombed hair. I also don't remember the soundtrack at all, so maybe that was an opportunity that went begging. Kidnapping is an interesting ride and worth a watch, especially as it is all true, but I do believe it could have had a lot more clout."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"Back in the early 1980s, Freddy Heineken, one of the richest men in the Netherlands and the head of Heineken International, was kidnapped along with his driver. Eventually, one of the largest ransoms ever was paid for his release. This film is about the kidnapping from the point of view of the crooks as well as its aftermath. This is interesting because you never see or hear anything about the police investigation--you only see the police when they are pouncing on the criminals at the end of the film. This all sounds very exciting....so why was I left so unaffected by the film? It is competently made but also rather ordinary."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"On the positive side, the music is really, really nice. It provides a taut atmosphere and some of the action sequences were very nice. Oddly, the most exciting moment in the film occurs early in the movie--well before the actual kidnapping. In order to raise funds to pull off the kidnapping, the gang knocks over a bank--and it's exactly what I assumed the rest of the film would be like. However, sadly, after this the kidnapping seemed a bit anticlimactic and the film just seems to descend into a state of adequacy and nothing more. I think much of it is because I never felt particularly connected with the kidnappers and the tension just seemed to dissipate until the relatively exciting finale. The bottom line is that this would be a decent film to rent, but I couldn't see heading to the theaters for this one."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"By the way, although the film is about Dutch kidnappers, everyone in the film was British! They sounded very British and although it was filmed in the Netherlands, it seemed more like a British gang there on holiday. The same story is told, incidentally, in a Dutch language film (The Heineken Kidnapping) starring Rutger Hauer as Freddy Heineken. In this British version, the filmmakers were able to secure the talents of Anthony Hopkins to play this beer baron."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,Kidnapping Freddy Heineken certainly lacks fizzle telling a true story set in Amsterdam in 1983. A group of friends who are builders fallen on hard times are turned down for a bank loan and decide on an outrageous plan to kidnap the head of the Heineken beer group.
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,They take Freddie Heineken (Anthony Hopkins) and his driver holding them hostage in specially built cells and issuing a massive ransom demand. The ransom is delivered but then their problems begins. The getaway with the money is not meticulously planned and their lack of experience as criminals backfires on them such as the desire to phone loved ones or feeling guilty about the crime.
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"Hopkins delivers a glorified cameo and like a wounded lion, shouts and screams with random outbursts and demands Chinese food, music and books. He is also worried that his chauffeur also being held in the next room is expendable."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"The rest of the actors, Sam Worthington, Jim Sturgess put in bland performances because the script is so flat. Worthington does have one scene in a dress for some weird reason."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,Director Daniel Alfredson directs with a lack of verve and urgency. The film does have one sequence of a car chase in Amsterdam which is impressive as they not only had to clear out all the tourists and install period details of the early 1980s. It would had been better such effort had been expended on the rest of the movie.
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"Fact more strange than fiction Peter R. de Vries both participated in and wrote the book about this true story from 1983 and collaborated on the screenplay with William Brookfield for this non-stop rousing caper film with a very bright young cast of actors directed by Daniel Alfredson. The film is well made, well photographed, well scored with an excellent musical selection and arrangement, and very well acted by a fine cast of young actors."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"In 1983, a group of childhood friends - Cor van Hout (Jim Sturgess), Willem Holleeder (Sam Worthington_ Jan 'Cat' Boellard (Ryan Kwanten), Frans 'sSpikes' Meijer (Mark van Weuwen), Martin 'Brakes' Erkmpps (Thomas Cocquerel) - pulled off the crime of the century: kidnapping one of the richest men in the world, the heir of the Heineken beer empire (Anthony Hopkins). The shocking capture --by gunpoint in broad daylight on the streets of Amsterdam--resulted in the largest ransom ever paid for a kidnapped individual. It was truly the perfect crimeuntil they got away with it. This is the inside story of the planning, execution, rousing aftermath and ultimate downfall of the kidnappers which resulted in the largest ransom ever paid for an individual. For a fast moving credible caper, this is a fine film, never letting down for a moment."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"How a crime drama with such good cast can be so dull is borderline a crime. The actors are good, but the characters they play have the personality of barren unsympathetic schmucks. The screenplay and conversation are dry, primarily dabbling in curses and complaints for nearly the entire movie. While there are clearly a couple of good moments by the actors, they are too few to sustain interest for the rest of boring banters."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"Kidnapping Mr. Heineken is exactly what it advertises, the story of five men who are down on their luck and decide to snatch a billionaire in hope for monetary gain. It's amazing that none of these five character is even close to being relatable. The movie tries to depicts individuals who are pushed to do illegal things, yet they are all manipulative, aggressive and severely lacking empathy."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"At latter half they are even interchangeable since everyone has a knack for whining, in exception of Sam Worthington's character who surprises audience with poor and crazy decisions. Probably the best decision the movie did was to put Anthony Hopkins as Heineken in a box and let him do a few monologues. Still, there is no tangible connection between Heineken and the kidnappers, there's not even connection between the kidnappers. When the movie tries to pull friendship theme, it only makes things more awkward."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"For action crime, one would expect an intelligent plot, perhaps major twists and thought out plans. There's a barely any level of sophistication here as five of them partially wing it and hope for the best. In fact, most of the times they are just fooling around, laughing annoyingly and verbally abusing each other."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,The film offers the shallow sense of helplessness and uneasiness as audience watch five aversive men threatening an old man for money and bicker with each other.
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"This film is based on such a bizarre crime, that it almost seems unreal. 'Kidnapping Mr. Heineken' or 'Kidnapping Freddy Heineken' as it's known in some foreign markets is the true life story of a group of friends who decide to kidnap the owner of Heineken Beer and force a ransom for millions of dollars. This crime actually happened back in the early 80s in the Netherlands."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"It's a decent enough story, however director Daniel Alfredson never brings any of the characters to life, nor does the story have any real intent other than just showing what happened, before abruptly ending after the last person was arrested. Alfredson is a great director too. His resume includes a couple of the original versions of 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' series where his younger brother Thomas directed the original 'Let The Right One In' film as well as 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy'."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"So off the bat, Daniel nor his brother Thomas are exactly lightweights. But with 'Kidnapping Mr. Heineken', Alfredson really only wanted to show the actual events with no depth whatsoever. The cast is solid as well with Sir Anthony Hopkins being chained and confined to a cell through most of the film as he plays Mr. Heineken. His kidnappers are played by Jim Sturgess ('Across the Universe'), Sam Worthington ('Avatar'), Ryan Kwanten ('True Blood'), amongst a couple others."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"This group of friends seem to be paid be some unknown person to evict and literally throw out squatters living in condemned housing. But these guys want more money and decide to kidnap the wealthiest person for a big ransom. That lucky person is Freddy Heineken of the beer company of the same name. They want to come across as professionals, which they are anything but, so they rob a bank to secure financing to build a sound proof room to make it look like an organized crime outfit executed this job."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"I'm sure you already know the outcome or can read it about it in a number of books, but was it worth making a film about? While the answer may be ""yes"", there needs to be some sort of depth to the characters other than that one of their girlfriend's is pregnant. Beyond that aspect, each kidnapper might as well be the same exact person. There just isn't much to work with, which is a shame. Sir Anthony Hopkins turns in a great performance, but is on screen for only a few minutes, and doesn't give us time to connect or sympathize with him whatsoever. At the very end of the film, which ends abruptly, there are title cards for each character of what eventually happened with them. The two lead kidnappers went to prison for a decade, but upon being released became the leaders of the biggest and most vicious mafias in the Netherlands."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"This would have made for such a better movie to see their rise to power with this kidnapping starting the entire reign of terror. Why they didn't make that, I'll never know. But as this film goes, 'Kidnapping Mr. Heineken' doesn't amount to much other than watching a few people kidnap a wealthy person and struggle with whether or not to release him or wait for the ransom money."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"2015's Kidnapping Mr. Heineken is the latest film co-starring Anthony Hopkins. At 95 hasty minutes, it's a true story adaptation devoid of inspiration yet loaded with veneer. Hopkins, with a voice that seems as mellifluous as the sound of crashing waves in the ocean, plays the title character. Portraying Freddy Heineken, he's a wealthy guy, the CEO of Heineken International (the beer company natch), and a debonair soul taken hostage by five desperate criminals. I gotta tell ya, Hannibal Lecter is a hoot playing this character. There's no fear in him and a certain nonchalantness to the way he's held captive in a soundproof room. He wants books to read, he needs some variance in the music played while awaiting ransom demands, and boy does he crave plenty of bang bang chicken from the local Chinese restaurant. Truth be told, I've never seen a characterized victim so laid back in his catastrophic predicament. This is just another business transaction for a guy who pisses a poultry, one million dollars."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"""Heineken"", with its crackling dialogue and Holland-based locales, is directed by newcomer Daniel Alfredson. As a motion picture, it moves at a riotously fast clip. It's witty and dark, nasty and last-ditch. We're talking lock, stock, and five smoking bandits. The film score featured is very calculated. It's baseline for a heist/abduction spectacle. And mind you, it's only made more effective by the lightning-quick editing that Mr. Hakan Karlsson bestows upon us (he cut the TV series, Millennium). But what's the basis for this vehicle I'm about to propose as a mixed review? Well, things end on a run-of-the-mill note. We're talking about true events with minimal evidence via the fugitives (an anonymous tip, really?), vacant spacial reckoning, and absolutely no one to root for. In all honesty, I figured the bad guys who were despicably charismatic here, would carry this thing through. I was wrong. I denounce these proceedings as a misstep of the most exorbitant order. Give me Point Break or 2010's The Town as a true, alternative viewing prospect."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"With a script based on a book by Peter R. de Vries and some rugged violence early on, Kidnapping Mr. Heineken follows five down on their luck schleps who use to run a business (it was unclear to me what they did for a living and that was frustrating). The time setting is early 80's posh and within the first few minutes, the thirtysomethings are seen trying to get a bank loan. They are in a sense, broke. Things then go afoul (loan approval is denied) leaving them no choice but to abduct Freddy Heineken (Hopkins). He's worth a boatload of money and their plan is to get at least thirty-five million Dutch guilders from him (at the time this was the highest ransom on record). The merry men/culprits consist of Willem Holleeder (played by Sam Worthington), Cor van Hout (played by Jim Sturgess), Jan Boellard (played by Ryan Kwanten), Frans Meijer (played by Mark van Eeuwen), and Martin Erkamps (played by Thomas Cocquerel). The names just mentioned are all real life people. They are Dutch criminals who are serving lengthy prison terms. The actors that play them give off a sort of goofball vibe. One moment they're serious and astute. The next minute they're ribbing each other, telling penis jokes, and taking male bonding to an unhinged, fraternity level. In essence, ""Heineken"" didn't garner my recommendation but I liked the way the cast played thespian ping pong on the back and forth tip."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"Now in all uprightness, I've never seen a movie where the screenwriters are so enthralled with the intricacies of kidnapping. It's as if they consulted known criminals currently serving life without parole. Every detail is woven into the first hour like the villainous characters wearing masks, all the felonious activity being done locally, the use of voice alteration to talk to victims, and the adage of a ransom note untouched by human fingerprints. Granted, this isn't an exercise about the people being taken nor is it a character study about law enforcement heavy on certain malefactor's trails. No what's on screen is strictly about the art of holding someone against their will. And it involves characters we really know nothing about. I mean how did these guys become professional criminals so quickly? And how is it that they know so much about the planning of such a heinous act? Finally, they are businessmen with families so what begot their vile nature? Then there's the other questions I asked myself during ""Heineken"". They pertained to the police. So OK, why doesn't a law official have any speaking lines? And why don't we the audience, get an idea of their inside strategy via bringing these despairing crooks to justice? Obviously, a lot of research went into formulating a hypothetical Kidnapping For Dummies. Too bad every other attribute fell by the wayside."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"All in all, this is not a disastrous crime drama, just a mediocre one. I viewed ""Heineken"" wondering why it took thirty-three years for its true story sensibilities to come to fruition. And as its ending credits filtered in, I also thought to myself, ""this is the culmination of three plus decades in development?"" The lowest point: Everyone involved really drops the ball with period detail. We're supposed to be taking in Amsterdam circa 1982. Instead, what's on screen could have probably passed as present day (all you gotta do is look at everybody's modern hairstyles to know what I'm getting at). Bottom line: This is a ho hum tribute presented by its filmmakers. It almost veers into slick, direct- to-video territory. In the beginning of its hour and a half-plus running time, the Jim Sturgess character (Cor van Hout) says, ""that's all crime is, it's a wager."" Interesting thought. I'd say if I had to wager anything on the staying power of this flick, it'd be a middling investment. My rating: A disappointing 2 and a half stars."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"All the elements are here but some things are not working. The actors give their all, but are a little cliched. I got the sense there was too much dialogue. The story itself is exciting enough, but I guess I've been spoiled by movies about Baader Meinhof and Gomorrah, where the leads were charismatic and the danger more pronounced, and the vision of Europe had more depth and colour. Call me crazy but I thought the lighting and the film stock used were running counter to the intrigue. It all seemed a little too high contrast indoors, and not enough contrast for the night scenes. And the film seemed to lack a little definition and could have been, well, less ordinary, more big screen. There were plenty of locations, but I still got the sense that all the action was taking place in a rather dull, single suburb. Then again, maybe in reality it did. On the plus side, I did think the depiction of the early 1980s was pretty good. I also thought the use of Sir Anthony Hopkins to be a redeeming stroke of genius. Of all the actors his sparse yet crucial use was a joy to behold, and lifted the entire movie. I thought Sam Worthington good too, and to be fair he somehow outshone his immediate friend and unofficial leader of the group, being a darker character and definitely better groomed. That's what I found frustrating about the movie, little things like uncombed hair. I also don't remember the soundtrack at all, so maybe that was an opportunity that went begging. Kidnapping is an interesting ride and worth a watch, especially as it is all true, but I do believe it could have have a lot more clout."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"This movie promised a heist, a historical kidnapping plot leading to the largest ransom paid in modern history AND Anthony Hopkins as the titular Mr. Heineken. Sadly, this movie failed to deliver. The motivations were at times unclear (There was mention of a major recession but we were never shown its far-reaching effects and thus could not empathize with out protagonists) and at times forced (all of a sudden there is a girlfriend involved who is now pregnant and needs to be financially supported and one protagonist's father appeared momentarily only to reveal he was fired by Mr. Heineken himself and we never hear from him again). The kidnappers were virtually indistinguishable yet the focus was on them instead of the police investigation or on Mr. Heineken's (and his driver's) plight in solitary. To top it off, the end text credits detailing the outcomes of the various characters (which can be found on wikipedia) were more interesting than most of the movie. I have to recommend passing on this and reading a brief synopsis of the real life case instead."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"I think the story could have been developed way more than what they did. In the first part of this movie, we get introduced to the main characters who - I have to say - have no blame at all in the low scoring of this movie: they are interesting, each one different from one another, with different dynamics going on. Somewhere along the way though, the director or the Writers decided that they needed to be quicker. That is where you can clearly sense how they push a Fast Forward button and every single development present in the first part of the movie is quickly and mercilessly unfold without any decent or (expected maybe)deeper explanation. As other reviewers have already written, this story could have definitely become an impressive Movie, especially thanks to the Actors who took part in it. I have given it a 6/10, but only because of the Actors and the interesting story."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"Bad reviews made me curious and tease me to watch. Especially if its about a true story (book). I am glad I watched it. As my family is partly Dutch I do have some knowledge about the kidnapping. As far as I know the movie is correct and according to reality. The story is thrilling at the moments it should be. From the perspective of the kidnappers: you almost feel pity for them. The great work of Sir A. Hopkins, although his role is limited, is as we want it to be! Superb. Maybe to short, but absolutely genius. Not toforget Sam Worthington (Avatar), Jim Sturgess, Ryan Kwanten, they made their positive contribution to the movie: scamp as they were, in scenes with Heineken and the driver! Nice scenes in Amsterdam and Paris. And yeah... the bottles must be brown instead of green: who cares!? Worth watching: absolute! Best film ever: no, but which one is? A kidnapping is always thrilling and excited: and so is this movie."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"For Once, Film Critics and Audiences Agreed across the board that this is one of the most Boring Crime Films Ever Produced on this level. The Acting, Action, and Story are so Literal and Lackluster one wonders Who Thought this Thing was worth Making or Releasing."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"It is so Matter of Fact and Unexciting. The Robbery to get the Money to Finance the Kidnapping is Frantic, Hyper-Edited with Everyone Shouting and Flailing about. It is just Painful to Watch."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"Then the Bickering starts to fulfill the ""Mr. Heineken"" Tagline. ""One can have Money or Friends, but can't have both."" Wow. How's that for Deep. All Backstories of All Involved in the Plot Dangle and Go Nowhere."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"The Film is Rendered with a Confusing Conclusion after the 90 Awful Minutes it took to get there. No Closure to Speak of as if the Filmmakers were in a Hurry to get it all Over with as Little Explanation and Ambiguity as Possible. No Suspense, Mysteries Hanging Everywhere, and the Audience Leaves Wondering WTF just happened?"
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"The Story, the Actors, and Everyone Involved in Making or Watching this Movie Deserves to be Served Something with More Gusto."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"Review: I really wasn't a big fan of this film because it's really slow and the storyline isn't that great. Its about 4 childhood friends who are in some financial problems so they come up with a bright idea, to kidnap Freddy Heineken for a huge ransom. I know that this ridiculous idea was plotted in 1988 so there wasn't security cameras everywhere like there is today but I really don't know how they thought that they were going to get away with such a huge heist. They seemed to be making it up as they went along and they didn't figure out a what they were going to do with the money until the end, which seemed a bit strange. For entertainment, it wasn't that great because the 4 childhood buddies seemed to be bickering most of the time and the money didn't really bring any joy to there life's. You didn't get to see what happened from the investigating point of view so the police kept on popping up out of the blue, without much explanation. Anthony Hopkins played his part well, as usual, but the 4 main characters didn't really bring intensity to such a difficult situation, which is mostly due to the writing. I'm sure that the money that they robbed to fund the kidnapping, could have cleared up some of there debt so I didn't have much sympathy for the dumb criminals. At the end of the day, it was blatant greed that pushed this guys on the run so they got everything that they deserved. Average!"
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"Round-Up: Sam Worthington has made some weird films since his big role in Avatar! He's had roles in Clash & Wraith of the Titans, which wasn't that bad but Termination Salvation wasn't that great. Since then, he's had some small projects like Sabotage, which was pretty average and Man on a Ledge which was also average but with some more Avatar movies in the pipeline, he really is set up for life. His acting style isn't the greatest but he has made some decent choices so at 38 years old, he really hasn't done too bad since making his debut in Hart's War in 2002. Anyway, the director of this movie Daniel Alfredson, also directed the Girl Who Played With Fire and the Girl Who Kicked The Hornets Nest, which were no way as good as the original and he has made quite a few TV series so he hasn't made that many movies for the big screen. He could have done a better job with this film, especially with Hopkins commitment to the project but the concept was interesting, as it's based on true events."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"I recommend this movie to people who are into their crime/drama movies about a group of childhood friends who come up with a plan to kidnap Mr. Heineken for a hefty ransom, to help them out of there financial difficulties. 4/10"
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"Based on a true story the film had the ingredients to be a brilliant film with big success, just look at the line up of cast in this film!! You would not of needed anthony hopkins if it was done right but there is that word ""if"" the screenplay and the script is very disappointing the film is good (well passable) but its just that it could and should of been done better the camera shots are like they were done by a toddler and when your looking forward to seeing this film your actually glad its only on for 92 minutes. I am being kind by giving the film a 5/10 but overall its a disappointment save your money and buy a case of Heineken and watch something else"
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,""" . . . He can have a lot of money, or he can have a lot of friends. But he cannot have both,"" is the Gospel according to Alfred ""Freddy"" Heineken of the green glass beer bottle fortune, paraphrasing Jesus about a man being able to hoard more than an average amount of stuff on Earth, or gain a place in Heaven, but definitely NOT both. Though any logical person who believes in Heaven knows that Mr. Heineken has been in that Other Place since he died in 2003, many Believers are unwilling to put their Faith in either Logic or Jesus' Teachings. KIDNAPPING MR. HEINEKEN is about five guys who think they can steal their way into the One Per Cent to figuratively rub elbows with Heineken and his ilk. What they do not realize is that any members of the One Per Cent with brains in their heads are paranoid and unhappy all the time with the threat of thugs like themselves staring them in the face, as well as the inevitability of spending Eternity in that Other Place. Taking money from the brainless One Per Centers (many of who inherited their excesses) is easier than saying ""Bernie Madoff,"" but KIDNAPPING MR. HEINEKEN proves that this is a quick route to Misery (unless you're a Robin Hood capable of distributing ""your"" wealth to the poor before it makes you radioactive)."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"The title says it all: ""The Kidnapping of Mr. Heineken."" Director Daniel Alfredson's take on the 1982 abduction of the Dutch brewing magnate breaks no new ground. However, the film is engrossing and well paced, despite an evident low-budget European production. Based on real events, the movie depicts a kidnapping that resulted in the largest ransom ever paid for a single individual. Set in Amsterdam, five down-on-their-luck buddies seemingly concoct the abduction and a preliminary bank robbery without a great deal of deep thought or careful planning. Somewhat surprisingly, a man of Heineken's immense wealth is taken easily, and the first-time criminals have beginner's luck all around. However, the ransom payment is dragged out, and tensions erupt among the men."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"While Anthony Hopkins plays the small part of Alfred ""Freddy"" Heineken convincingly, when shackled in a cell, he displays familiar flashes of Hannibal Lector. Although Sam Worthington and Jim Sturgess head the kidnappers, most of the faces are lesser known, but, like Hopkins, all acquit themselves nicely. The film is better than average, and, with a fairly short running time, introduces viewers unfamiliar with the crime to some of the details, despite accusations of inaccuracy. ""The Kidnapping of Mr. Heineken"" moves fast, is worth a look, and will keep most viewers entertained."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"Crime films can either be tragic or comic, and some of them try to be both. The masters of the comic crime films is, of course, the Coen Brothers. But when crime films try to be just violent or tragic, they tend to miss the mark. There are exceptions, of course, like The Godfather, but films like those are a once in a generation occurrence; the other 99 films of the genre are usually average unless they contain humor.
This film is practically humorless, despite a few lame attempts by veteran actor Hopkins to be pithy. His portrayal of Heineken, however, is impeccable. The other actors had an IQ of over 150; unfortunately however, that was the combined score of all five members of the incident. Poorly planned and executed; with no forethought of how and where they would go after the ransom was retrieved, this group of imbeciles thought they wouldn't be noticed missing from their normal routines once the ransom was paid. Didn't it ever occur to them that if just ONE of them was apprehended, the other four were toast as well? So, we are introduced to the five comrades early on, and are supposed to be sympathetic to them in some way. But we aren't. We consider them idiots, and for good reasons. Did this incident have any chance of success, whatsoever? Absolutely not. Simple math was against them from the start.
If you have ONE man who is a serial killer and kills one person in one incident, you have a limited set of clues to follow, and in many cases, the crime will go unsolved. But if you have FIVE people committing a crime you multiply the variables of things that can go wrong by five; and then your chances are far less likely to succeed. The plot of the film is interesting, and the inevitable conclusion is to be expected, but with a few bumps in the road. Worth viewing. PS - Showing Mr. Heineken at the start of the film as a flashback was, in my opinion, a big mistake, as it clearly gives away the inevitable ending of the film. I would be willing to bet well over 80% of the audience would not have known whether Mr. Heineken had survived or perished in real life before they watched this film."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"This is based on a true story/event, so if you are aware of that ""case"" or have read into it (I didn't before I watched the movie), you know the answer. Obviously I won't reveal that in my review. I will say that I originally planned on giving it a 6/10, but the actors involved convinced me to go for the 7."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"Don't get me wrong, there are many confinements in their ""parts"" and there are more than a couple of obstacles that seem to high to overcome. But this is as mentioned based on real people. So while some things probably were changed or added with creative liberty, the general feel of the people involved could not be just changed. And while some criticize Sam Worthingtons character and his ""poor"" decisions, I personally do disagree. I wouldn't act like him, but while he's a hot head, there is some sense in what he's doing"
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"Jim Sturgess and Sam Worthington star in this inside story of the planning, execution, rousing aftermath and ultimate downfall of the kidnappers of beer tycoon Alfred ""Freddy"" Heineken (Sir Anthony Hopkins), which resulted in the largest ransom ever paid for an individual."
Kidnapping Mr. Heineken,"I went into this thinking I would like this film, but really it was rather boring. We never really get a good insight into why these guys did this, and I would think we would get a more important film out of this filmed story than this- which was basically a direct-to-on-demand-platforms-?? Hopkins' talents are a bit wasted in his role, and as far as our two main stars- Sturgess and Worthington- really have never been terribly impressed with any of their acting work to date, so maybe the film could've been better casted, or the screenwriter(s) could've given everyone in the picture a little more to do-?? Thumbs down, unfortunately.."
Get Hard,"Get Hard was a film I really wasn't expecting to like much, but it was significantly funnier than I expected it to be. Will Ferrell's films have had a tendency to be a bit like Russian Roulette as of late, but this one is fortunately one with no bullet in the chamber. Ferrell plays James, a market trader with (in some people's books) an idyllic life: beautiful house, beautiful fiancée (the boss's daughter) and more money that Trump could shake a stick at."
Get Hard,"But the idyll is shattered when he is arrested and then convicted of corruption on a massive scale. Wanting to set a public example , the judge sentences him to the delights of San Quentin and James has 30 days to ""Get Hard"" before being thrown to the mercy of the inmates. Helping him in the task is Kevin Hart (""Ride Along"") who, primarily for reasons of personal financial gain, pretends to be much more 'street' than he really is."
Get Hard,"What I enjoyed about this film was the leisurely set up of character and plot before the real comedy (the 'training') kicked in. This is where Ferrell and Hart really work together well, and I thought Hart was excellent in his role. Also good to see Craig T. Nelson (""Poltergeist"", ""Blades of Glory"") back on the big screen as James's boss."
Get Hard,"There are few films where I have guffawed out loud so much at certain points: some really good visual slapstick humour. However, the film will be far from everyone's tastes, with some very close to the knuckle jokes. In particular things come to a 'head', as it were, with some mano-a-mano action between Ferrell and Matt Walsh (""VEEP"", ""Into the Storm""), where the crudometer gets cranked up to ""Farrelly"". The film is also let down by a weak ending and if there was a joke to be had in the last line of the film, it completely flew over my head."
Get Hard,Recommended for some good belly laughs for the broad minded.
Get Hard,(If you enjoyed this review please see the graphical version at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email address to get future reviews. Thanks).
Get Hard,"Which is the title the movie got in Germany (for a change it's not an English title, but in German). Considering the comedy talent at hand, I understand that some might be disappointed in this. But it's still decent enough, even with some mediocre jokes thrown in there from time to time. Not to mention the fact, that this is as predictable as it gets (story wise that is)."
Get Hard,"Not sure if the jokes about homosexuality work most of the time either, but you have to give/cut them some slack for trying (while not dumbing them down too much). The word play is there (see title), which is played out pretty nicely in one particular scene (turning point sort of). Don't expect too much and you'll be entertained"
Get Hard,"Get Hard is a comedy starring two of the funniest actors out there today, and having this duo of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell you would think would make for an extremely funny movie, unfortunately it doesn't but it still had its fair share of good laughs. They had pretty good chemistry and most if not all of the good funny moments came from the interactions between the two of them. They played off the racial stereotypes for pretty much the entire film and as the film went on it got less funny and repetitive. The good moments of the film in terms of the comedy came in the middle of the film, thats where you have everyone introduced and the build up is over but you are also not yet exhausted by the repetitive jokes. In terms of their performances, there is nothing new here, it feels like they were both playing similar characters that they have played many times before in their previous films. But the characters did fit very well into the plot."
Get Hard,"The plot of the film was a little predictable, but at the same time i wasn't bored of following the plot. It didn't feel like certain plot points happened in order to get a few quick jokes in, everything flowed pretty well and i was still interested in seeing what was going to happen next. There is not much else i can say about this film, there is nothing new to see here from Will or Kevin, but the film does provide with some good jokes and an interesting plot that can get you through the film fairly entertained. So i guess if you are a fan of either member of this comedy duo then you will enjoy seeing them together in this film. - 5/10"
Get Hard,"Nothing original - just a series of stolen monologues taken from past N.Y. & L.A. studios' formula of: 1. Stereotyping black and white views of each other (well, OK, ball park 90% were from the white camp). 2. Stereotyping rich and poor and their accompanying behaviors; as well as each toward the other (well, OK, 90% mostly put-downs of the wealthy). 3. Loads of obscenities for those still stick-stuck in that compensation stage of life (ages 13-17), or just as a convenient multipurpose tool to replace language never learned in school. 4. Lots of sex/drugs references to support #3 above and most importantly to give a dull, if not boring, script an edge. 5. Predictable martial arts action exchanges throughout the film as well as their eventual outcomes. Martial arts obviously rescued by stunt doubles and camera angles. 6. Ferrell looked tired; Hart looked stuck-in-a-rut. 7. Boils down to typical mental movie junk food, ball park: (80% of what comes out of the N.Y. & L.A. studios; 90% out of Bolly studios; 95% of releases from both Mexican TV & film studios)."
Get Hard,"James King (Will Ferrell) is a wealthy stockbroker with a seemingly perfect and enviable lifestyle (big house, hot girlfriend etc). However, things come to a head when evidence is found to show that King has committed acts of fraud and embezzlement. In order to make an example out of him and to show that 'rich people' won't get an easy ride, the judge sentences King to the maximum sentence of 10 years in prison at San Quentin which is one of America's toughest prisons. King isn't prepared for life in prison and based on a conversation that he has with Darnell (Kevin Hart) he makes the assumption that Darnell has been to prison before and King offers to pay Darnell $30,000 dollars to toughen up ready for prison life which King will be facing in the next 30 days. Being hugely in debt and for his family's sake, Darnell agrees to prepare King for life in prison (even though he's never been in prison in his life!!!)."
Get Hard,"Both Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart have both been hit and miss actor's in my book and therefore I approached this film with some caution and actually feared the worst. However, after watching it I thought it was much better than I expected it to be - although it isn't without it's fair share of problems...."
Get Hard,The storyline is fairly generic and there's definitely a whiff of Trading Places about it (it only really steals one aspect from that film rather than feeling like a 'rip-off' of that film). If you're expecting to see much originality in the material then you're going to be a little disappointed - quite a bit of the material is recycled prison clichés and much of this is witnessed when Darnell puts King through his toughening up boot-camp.
Get Hard,"Despite some of these problems there were some parts of the film that got some big laughs from me; I couldn't help but laugh at the scenes where King tries to pick fights with people at the park (with one scene where he picks on an old man and gets his ass kicked). I also loved the part where Martin (Craig T Nelson) is talking about how he built his successful business with just a computer, hard work and an $8,000,000 loan from his dad - it doesn't sound that funny when it's put in writing, but the way Nelson delivers the gag does make it funny. It's stuff like this that helps to take the edge of the cruder stuff that is witnessed at other moments in the film."
Get Hard,"Another strength with this film lies with the performances of Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart. The former is actually very good at acting as a 'whiny' jerk (perhaps too good), but in a film like Get Hard this style of acting works to his advantage and it really is hard not to laugh at some of the things that he says and does here. Hart is not someone who I've been too kind to in the past, but I think that I've never really seen him in a role that I've felt that he can put his own stamp on (until now). In some ways I thought that Hart steals the show here and in some ways seeing a much smaller figure like Hart being physically dominant over someone as large as Ferrell somehow made the scenario funnier to me. Both these actors share brilliant chemistry together and in some ways their physical humour and terrific performances overcome the fairly weak story."
Get Hard,"I've been generally positive with this film so far but I think it's important to draw your attention to some weaknesses with the film. Whilst it clearly relies on race issues to carry it in the early stages it always feels palatable (a basic misunderstanding based on 'race' is what lead to King making his assumption). This, for me, was tolerable in order to set the story up, but later in the film it starts to go off the rails a little bit by providing us with some forced and unnecessary moments (I felt that the scenes with The Crenshaws and The Alliances Of Whites) were a little too much and I don't feel that they were particularly necessary. It's also predictable and isn't funny often enough for me to be able to shout its praise from the rooftops."
Get Hard,"With all that being said though, some of the material is funny, Ferrell and Hart are both excellent here and the chemistry between the two men is first-rate. It's not brilliant, but on the same note it was funny enough for me."
Get Hard,"Laughter is the best medicine & a comedy film essentially does that. And 'Get Hard' is among those winning comedies, that despite its crude humor & language, made me laugh hard! Its a fun watch."
Get Hard,"'Get Hard' Synopsis: When millionaire James King is jailed for fraud and bound for San Quentin, he turns to Darnell Lewis to prep him to go behind bars."
Get Hard,"'Get Hard' is consistently fun. Jay Martel, Ian Roberts & Etan Cohen's Screenplay, though very crude, is hilarious & the camaraderie between its protagonists, works massively. Though a bit lengthier than it should have been, the Writing is mostly packed with good jokes & sequences. Etan Cohen's Direction is decent. Cinematography is richly done. Editing is slightly iffy."
Get Hard,"Performance-Wise: Its good to see both, Will Ferrell & Kevin Hart, at their comedic best. Ferrell is no less than a treasure here as the innocent under scrutiny, while Hart, as his guru, oozes tremendous energy. And as a team, they both work superbly! Among others, the ever-dependable Craig T. Nelson, leaves a mark."
Get Hard,"On the whole, 'Get Hard' will make you laugh! Watch It!"
Get Hard,"The crudely titled ""Get Hard"" is a version of ""Pygmalion"" the likes of which George Bernard Shaw could never possibly have imagined."
Get Hard,"Here the roles have been reversed, with the learned professor transmogrified into a streetwise working-class regular guy (Kevin Hart), while the lower-class flower girl has become a highly successful hedge fund manager (Will Ferrell). When the latter is unjustly convicted of embezzling funds and sentenced to ten years in prison, the desperate man turns to Hart to instruct him in the fine art of staying alive behind bars."
Get Hard,"Hart and Ferrell do yeoman work with some pretty shoddy material, which boils down, essentially, to a 100-minute-long prison-rape joke, with homophobic attitudes that are, quite frankly, shocking to behold in the second decade of the 21st Century."
Get Hard,"There are a few funny moments when Ferrell spends an afternoon with Hart's relatives in the 'hood, but the movie is clearly more concerned with indulging in crude slapstick than in delivering anything even remotely resembling biting social satire."
Get Hard,"When millionaire hedge fund manager James is found guilty of fraud and bound for a stretch in San Quentin, the judge gives him 30 days to get his affairs in order."
Get Hard,"Desperate, he turns to Darnell to prep him for a life behind bars. But despite James' one- percentage assumptions, Darnell is a hard-working small business owner who has never received a parking ticket, let alone been to prison."
Get Hard,"Together, the two men do whatever it takes for James to be prepared and, in the process, discover how wrong they were about a lot of things........including each other."
Get Hard,"Kevin Hart is quickly becoming this generations Pauly Shore, good on TV, but his films are getting poorer and poorer, and it's becoming clear now that he hasn't the star power that the studios would like you to think."
Get Hard,"But it's not his fault, he has screen presence, it's just that the material he is given is lost in the Stone Age, as this is the type of movie where racism, sexual assault and sexual orientation panic are the height of comedy, and this became tiresome in the nineties."
Get Hard,"The plot is basically a blatant rip of the Rob Schneider movie 'Big Stan' and Ferrell is doing the same schtick here he's been doing for years when he isn't Ron Burgundy, and that too is becoming tiresome."
Get Hard,"So we endure nearly two hours of Hart stereotyping every culture, because this prepares you for prison. And we have Ferrell dress as a gang member and mock his ethnicity, because this will give the film balance, and prepare you for prison."
Get Hard,"To call it offensive is an understatement, when the supposed comedy highlight of the film is Ferrell on his knees in a toilet, makes you disgusted rather than laughing heartily, the film is losing."
Get Hard,"But there is the odd funny moment, any time when Ferrell and Hart are in a wide shot, its hilarious to see how taller Ferrell is, the height of vertically challenged comedy."
Get Hard,This generations Eddie Murphy? Now that sentence is funnier than the whole film.
Get Hard,Get Hard? get lost more like........
Get Hard,"Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart have teamed up together for their latest comedy project called 'Get Hard' with enough double entendres for two movies. There are a couple of similarities from 'Trading Places' and 'Nothing To Lose' here in 'Get Hard', but nothing really seems genuine or charming enough to remember this film much beyond two minutes after viewing it. Etan Cohen (not to be confused of the Coen Bros.) steps into the director's seat for the first time, but has written screenplays such as 'Men In Black III', 'Tropic Thunder', and 'Idiocracy'. Clearly, he has some writing talent, but with 'Get Hard', it seems like he just let Ferrell and Hart do their own thing, which can be outrageously funny at times, but can also run off on long tangents, which often happens with this movie."
Get Hard,"This movie survives and fails by its overdone racial, gender, and sexual humor, all of which has been done many times before this film. It's a tired and exhausting trope with these new comedies, however Hart and Ferrell's chemistry is quite good. The setup is with James King (Ferrell), an extremely wealthy investment banker who is as white bred as they come. He lives in a giant house with his materialistic fiancée Alissa (Alison Brie) and works at a large investment firm where his boss Martin (Craig T. Nelson) is also his future father-in-law."
Get Hard,"Things look good for James until the authorities arrest James at work for securities fraud and embezzlement. He sticks to his guns that he is innocent and was framed, but the judge gives him ten years in prison. Now James has 30 days until he has to report to prison, and being the guy he is, won't last a day in jail. That's when he enlists the help of the black guy who washes his car, Darnell (Hart) for help, because according to James, 1 out of every 3 black people will end up in jail at some point."
Get Hard,"What kind of help does James want from Darnell, who secretly has grown up in the suburbs, far from any street gangs? It's the kind of help that will make James ""get hard"" or get tough enough so he will be able to avoid rape and murder in prison, which is apparently all that happens when doing hard time, according to to these two characters. So over a few montage scenes of physical training, shoving things in your rectum, and a gay brunch out on the town where oral sex is highly likely, we see Darnell toughen up James."
Get Hard,"That is until Darnell finally believes that James is innocent and tries to help him clear his name. Nothing in this movie really makes any sense. Everything is over-the-top and tries to hard to be funny, outrageous, and vulgar. I think certain people will try to say this is homophobic and somewhat racist, but I disagree. These are comedians who are using the stereotypes for comedy, but never in a hurtful way. It's all in good fun, but it outstays it's welcome early on. The only thing that matters with this film are Ferrell and Hart, as every other plot device and character are only given a couple of minutes of screen time with no real resolution or point to why anything is happening on screen."
Get Hard,"'Get Hard' is the product of two very talented comedic actors who made a movie where they basically have no script and given free reigns to just riff one joke off another for two hours. There are some minor laughs and at least one scene that has Ferrell literally on his knees, deciding on whether or not to go all the way in, but it's not enough to make the entire film memorable or even that good."
Get Hard,"This film is exceedingly puerile. Obviously, the target demographic is white, straight, 15-year-old boys. Some of the jokes and gags were mildly amusing, and many were wince-inducingly bad or exceptionally repulsive. It is pretty hard to make rape funny and every effort in this movie failed. I realize that the racial and homosexual stereotypes were being played for laughs (usually not achieving them) but I thought that this wasn't allowed anymore. Micro-aggressions and all that. I just can't keep up with the rules of political correctness. One thing that the material couldn't hide was the beauty and talent of Edwina Findlay and Alison Brie."
Get Hard,"I don't get why people like Will Ferrell. I've seen several of his movies over the last year, and I've laughed maybe just over a half dozen times at the dozen or so films I've seen him in."
Get Hard,"And this film, other than the fact that it's about prisoners or criminals, has the worst jokes ever. I can't imagine anyone being in the theatre and seriously laughing at this junk."
Get Hard,"Admittedly, I chuckled, and I do emphasize chuckle because I didn't laugh, a few times in this film. It wasn't entirely without humor, but the jokes were so base, the humor so low brow, the comic timing so poor, that one wonders what's happened to the aggregate IQ of the people of the United States of America."
Get Hard,"A predictable script / story, some tasteless sexual situations, I wondered if the prisoner population, or people related and relating to prisoners, was such a big demographic that Will Ferrell and the powers that be thought this would be a good film to make."
Get Hard,"Everyone I've talked to smirks and thinks Will Ferrell is Luke warm funny, me included. He's not entirely without humor. But he and his films are not the product of comic genius."
Get Hard,"Hey look, if you've ""done time"", need to laugh at your incarceration, then maybe this film is for you, but otherwise give me the Three Stooges or Warner Brothers' cartoons any day over this garbage."
Get Hard,Avoid.
Get Hard,"So the whole plot of the movie is, that it is perfectly normal to get raped in a US prison. And as we learn at the end of the movie: this is also perfectly fine if it happens to the bad guys. It's so fine we can all have a good laugh about it."
Get Hard,"In a time of the false Rolling Stone mass rape story, in a time where rape culture is seen everywhere except when it happen to men, in a time where we have countless ""survivors of rape"" in a ""rape culture"", in a time where ""Hunting Ground"" was made....in this time it is perfectly fine to make a comedy that circles around only one thing: that it is normal and really funny to get raped as a man in a US prison."
Get Hard,"Definite, there is a rape culture in many countries. It is about how normal it is that males get raped in prison and how the bad guys earn to get raped. It's so normal that our society can make a nice comedy of that situation."
Get Hard,"Now, if you think I am exaggerating: try to imagine a comedy where a female is threatened to get raped every day for the next 10 years. A comedy. And when she can clear her name at the end then we all are happy that two other bad ladies now get raped instead. Do you laugh now or feel sick? Then why don't you feel sick when it happens to a man?"
Get Hard,"Another throwaway comedy from Ferrell? yeah pretty much. Despite the fact this guy is mega famous and has made some solid movies, his filmography is top heavy with throwaway garbage, literately littered with trashy flicks. I find it weird that three of his worst movies happen to be about various sporting events, ice skating, tennis and NASCAR racing."
Get Hard,"So lets be honest here this movie is simply one big stereotype, one big cliché, every angle is nailed well and truly...almost to an offensive level. Put simply, Ferrell plays a rich successful businessman who works for a large company. He has it all including a mansion, flashy automobile, slick suits and a hot fiancée, he is on top of the world. Then as quickly as his lavish lifestyle is presented to us, its all torn down as he is accused of corruption. He now has 30 days until he goes to jail for the next ten years. In desperation he turns to humble car washer Kevin Hart for help, his request? to train him for prison life, to get him hard, tough, butch. At the same time Ferrell's character must also try to figure out how he was busted when he is innocent."
Get Hard,"I don't wanna sound overly politically correct mainly because I can't stand the modern extremist PC trend, but damn is this entire story just one big insult. I mean lets look at the actual premise, Ferrell's character is a stereotypical rich, smart, white character, Kevin Hart is actually a hard working honest black character. Yet King (Ferrell) goes to Lewis (Hart) for help simply because he is a black man and he automatically assumes he will know about being in prison, criminal life, or automatically assumes he has been to prison. Right there you have a bit of a no no technically, not a great start."
Get Hard,"From there on Lewis helps King train for prison, this naturally entails every single stereotypical prison cliché in the book. All prison inmates are automatically assumed to be either black or hispanic/latino with all the regular well known clichés that accompany that outlook. You know exactly what I mean, virtually all the characters are big, tattooed, gold teeth, bling, baggy pants around the hips, shades, silly headgear and loads of profanity and street lingo. Of course revolving around prison there will also be lots of homosexual references, gags, innuendos and slapstick. One sequence actually shows King trying his hand at oral sex on a man! he doesn't actually do it of course but we do actually see a penis! full screen! was it fake? looked real to me. But its not just people of colour that are hit, to counter the black and latino gangs there are of course the stereotypical redneck, black leather clad, white biker gangs just so no one feels left out."
Get Hard,"What's funny is even the presentation of Ferrell's character is a slightly offensive or annoying stereotype. A weedy, wussy, straight- laced, well spoken, college grad type that is unable to interact with lower income people and treats them like slave labour. All the people that clean his huge mansion appear to be Mexicans and all the workers in Ferrell's company are white, not a single person of colour to be seen. The black street gang the duo visit for help later in the movie are the epitome of movie stereotypes (the women with the gang are all dressed and act like sluts etc...). This entire movie is enough to give all the social justice warriors out there a heart attack. The fact that we all know deep down most of this is kinda accurate to reality anyway isn't the point (it really isn't), everything we see is so tired, old, formulaic and unoriginal its just not really funny."
Get Hard,"The story isn't even particularly relatable or realistic anyway which affects the comedy. The first scenes we see of King revolve around his luxurious lifestyle, so basically its just like watching Will Ferrell in his own real life because we all know these movie stars live in massive abodes, driving supercars with hot partners. Later on in the movie as King's training becomes more intense they actually convert his home into a makeshift prison? Putting bars on windows, electrified barbwire fencing and spotlights around the grounds, creating a cell, using his cleaners as prison wardens etc...I realise its just a dumb comedy going for laughs but would anyone really go to those lengths? it just seems like stretching for a visual gag. Indeed most of the jokes here solely rely on really grasping for laughs with forced visual tomfoolery, or they just bank on the old racist, homophobic, sexist angle to win the day."
Get Hard,"Admittedly there were a few moments that made me smile, a few bits of dialog that made me chuckle, I can't recall them now but it happened. The second half the film gets a bit better as we discover how and why King got set up, although this doesn't enhance Craig T.Nelson's role in the movie, nor does it explain his decision for being here in the first place. The one thing I did like about the film was the fact its an adult movie with adult things...like some nice moments of tits n ass (sexist remark is recognised, hypocrisy noted). In this day and age I'm actually stunned this type of movie is allowed to go ahead and the fact it actually did well! Yes its good to laugh at ourselves and each other, no harm in that, but these days is risky lets not beat around the bush. Bottom line everyone knows what they're getting into with this, its all quite intentional and they do hit their marks, but that doesn't mean its good."
Get Hard,4.5/10
Get Hard,then it became disgusting!!!!
Get Hard,I guess it is the sheer lack of new and good ideas or the perceptible decrease of the average citizen's IQ that prompts people to make this garbage.
Get Hard,"For the first twenty minutes or so, it was an unfunny film, stale jokes, the usual silliness of Will Ferrell. Then, the writers,directors decided to amp up the gross-out humor and the audience is served with a scene where Ferrel's character is learning how to perform fellatio on another guy..."
Get Hard,"Well, this was supposed to be a comedy? But, if this is what is funny these days, I am even more worried about the future of this country."
Get Hard,"Totally tasteless, crass. Only those with the IQ of baboons will find this insult to a thinking brain funny."
Get Hard,"This comedy covers lots of current criminals and racial and class stereotypes. It's quite laugh out loud funny throughout and more clever than crude. Watch out for lots of unexpected one liners. Of course there are some crude moments - what comedy doesn't have them but I think it is more relevant and funny than the Seth Rogan type comedies. After a rising fund manager millionaire gets arrested and convicted of fraud, he hires a black man to get him ready for prison. Will Ferrell is good and makes some painful moments bearable. Kevin Hart is good too not over doing it - his ""prison yard"" scene is well done. Alison Brie of Mad Men is surprisingly alluring as Will's girlfriend. John Mayer makes a small cameo. You have the white white collar criminal - fund manager of course, black ex prison gang members, neo Nazi white supremacists, gays. It's funny in each different situation especially teaching the gang members about finance."
Get Hard,One of the funnier comedies in recent years.
Get Hard,Get Hard (2015)
Get Hard,*** (out of 4)
Get Hard,Millionaire James King (Will Ferrell) gets ten years in prison for a crime he didn't commit but he still needs to learn how to survive on the inside so he hires Darnell (Kevin Hart) to teach him how to be hard. James thinks just because Darnell is black that he's been in prison but what he doesn't know is that Darnell is just as chicken as him when it comes to fighting.
Get Hard,"GET HARD isn't a complete success but there's no question that the two leads are in good form and there are enough laughs that make this worth sitting through. If you're looking for some sort of masterpiece or high-art comedy then you're not going to find it here. There's nothing clean about this movie as it attacks all races, sexes and genders as it pretty much tries to offend anyone and goes for the most obvious and at times graphic jokes that it can. There was some pre-release controversy about some of the stereotype jokes but I think it's safe to say that everyone is insulted so it's fair game."
Get Hard,"I think the best thing going for the film is the chemistry between Ferrell and Hart. Both of them work well off of one another and especially whenever the screenplay lets them down. In all honesty, there's not too much here that we haven't seen in other comedies about prison but the two actors take the material and make it much better than it actually is. One of the highlights in the film is when Ferrell is supposed to go up to some tough guys and start a fight. The terror that Ferrell gets across was just hilarious."
Get Hard,"The formula is pretty predictable as is the outcome. With that said, I'd guess that only around sixty percent of the jokes actually work but there are enough big ones to make the film worth viewing."
Get Hard,"I wonder if what the critics don't like about this movie is that it is actually clever, funny and vulnerable. I am glad I resisted the critic reviews and saw it. The performances by all actors are genuine. And of course there is just enough physical comedy and absurdity to make it silly in a good way."
Get Hard,"Don't listen to the crusty old curmudgeons its a fun movie to watch. Some of the jokes are actually intelligent and you have to know a little about what is going on economically and racially in the Country to really get them. The only thing that I find puzzling is in every movie that has biker gangs, they never seem to get them right. They always portray them cartoony that was the only thing that I found disinteresting and only because of aesthetics."
Get Hard,Its a cute comedy. Don't be turned away by the crusty critics
Get Hard,"This is the worst movie Will Farrell starred in, period. The guy stooped really low on this one. And for me, coming from a person who really liked his movies, such as Anchorman (2004), Lego Movie (2014) and even The Other Guys (2010), this one was the absolute worst I've seen from him. The movie had zero humor, the protagonist isn't even likable, and the credence of the story has no involvement whatsoever. The degree to which this movie doesn't even attempt - ATTEMPT - to hold any meaning or credence for the movie (and also resulting in an exceedingly embarrassing moment which I will NOT even attempt to put into words) makes this... it is not a good movie. And is by far, the worst movie ever made by Farrell."
Get Hard,"Unless you are brain dead, or just have a Will Farrell marathon running, you shouldn't bother watching this movie. It is a waste."
Get Hard,"This seemed more like a montage flick with one step after another of teaching some guy how to survive in prison. And the montage parts was the only redeeming part about this movie. And it wasn't even all that funny. It's basically one of those movies where the trailer is more amusing then the actual movie itself. Will Ferrell is once again playing the same character that he always plays, which is basically a man-child. Except he has the smarts for business, but no common sense. Kevin Hart is the same when it comes to the characters he plays, except I found him more to be likable in this and less obnoxious. I was just bored with this movie and had a slight headache when it was finished. Overall this is a dull comedy that is uber cheesy and lacks any real creativity. It might be amusing for some, but it didn't really float my boat."
Get Hard,4.5/10
Get Hard,"The concept of Get Hard is funny, so it feels like this movie should work at least to some degree. Will Ferrell plays a clueless guy who is going to jail for white collar crimes, and he just assumes the guy who washes his car (played by Kevin Hart) has gone to prison before. So he hires this blue collar guy to prepare him for prison, not realizing that Hart is one of the most straightlaced normal people you could ask for and has never even been arrested. I feel like part of the reason the film didn't quite click for me was the fact that Will Ferrell seems to have his entire performance turned up to 11. He is not subtle in any way and instead of making the movie more humorous it is actually less funny when he goes to these extremes. On the flip side the one time Kevin Hart takes his performance up a notch (with some clear improv) it is actually good for a few laughs, but most of the way through he's forced to be the straight man. Another problem with Get Hard is that it doesn't take the time to address the extreme racism of certain parts of the plot, to the point that the movie treats it as more of a betrayal when Hart lies about his experience with prison than when Ferrell assumes he has gone there because of the color of his skin."
Get Hard,"The ""training"" that commences is all over the place and feels utterly moronic, which should be fine based on the premise of the film, because neither of these guys know anything about going to prison. Yet we're meant to believe that this series of odd training techniques does start to teach the main character how to survive. In fact, he becomes so in touch with the idea of prison life that he starts to teach himself some extra tricks that he feels will come in handy. The number of ""jokes"" that come merely from the fact that he has learned to hold things up his butt, is kind of embarrassing. There are a couple of fun scenes in the film that saved me from utter boredom and disgust. The biggest highlight was probably when this successful stock trader teaches a gang how to invest their money in the stock market in order to make millions, and they go on to have serious arguments with one another about the handling of different stocks. Otherwise, the plot of this film is so basic that I could predict exactly where it was going from the first scene, and it was just a matter of waiting to see what kind of stupid stuff would happen on the way to that conclusion. I've certainly hated comedies more than this one, but Get Hard did nothing to make me like it either."
Get Hard,"Etan Cohen's ""Get Hard"" is an absolutely abysmal comedy for more reasons than it takes the worst attributes of both its lead performers and tries to make a ninety-four minute film rely on them. The film makes the classic mistake of assuming that all it takes to be funny is to be mindlessly vulgar and have several sight gags masquerading as comedy, forgoing any semblance of wit and subtly in order to be as brazen as possible. When Will Ferrell's straight-laced character was reading off numerous insults he concocted himself, and one of them was ""I will punch you right in the f***,"" I knew what kind of comedy was on my hands, and I wanted to wash them thoroughly with soap and water."
Get Hard,"This is a hopelessly dirty and incompetently racist film, but it's far too stupid and narrow-minded to be seen as truly offensive. Admittedly, however, to see a film like this get made in 2015, in a time where political correctness runs rampant, is very surprising, but nonetheless, to be offended by ""Get Hard"" gives the film too much credit. It implies that a strong reaction was prompted during the film where the film doesn't deserve such. It deserves to be dismissed and quietly swept away to late night TV on Comedy Central where its only audience will be insomniacs and very curious cinephiles. With the ample amount of Judd Apatow comedies that have proved they can be raunchy and heartfelt, there's no place for a film like ""Get Hard"" and its breathless attempts to be funny."
Get Hard,"The film concerns James King (Will Ferrell), a wealthy hedge-fund manager who is engaged to a gold-digging woman and working for his father's company. He has an enormous house and is constantly reminded of how important it is to go after one's goals by his manipulative wife who sees nothing but untold dollar signs in him. During his birthday party, James is indicted on several counts of embezzlement and is given a month leeway before he's sentenced to ten years in a maximum security prison (this part makes ""Get Hard"" kind of a fantasy film, but I digress)."
Get Hard,"In order to find out how to survive in prison, James seeks out the first black man he sees, a man named Darnell Lewis (Kevin Hart), who works in a car wash at James' office. Despite Darnell never having been to prison, he sees James' racial profiling and stupidity as pitiful traits and agrees to help him for $30,000. Darnell concocts a rigorous prison training course, complete with weight-lifting, prison riots, ""kiestering,"" and gay sex in order to make James ""hard"" (aka ready for prison)."
Get Hard,"As expected, ""Get Hard"" descends into the ""maximum antics, minimum laughter"" realm of comedy fairly quickly. Jokes and sight gags are fired constantly, but all of which burdened by embedded stereotypes, shallow writing, mundane vulgarity, or a combination of the three. During these scenes, Ferrell plays bumbling and clueless and Hart plays frantic and loud, effectively minimizing each of their talents to conform to the bottom-barrel screenplay at hand. The sole merit of the film is how it appears to evoke the tired idea perpetuated by the wealthy that all the poor or the working class need to do is pull themselves up by their bootstraps and they too can be as successful as they are. This scene is demonstrated pretty effectively during the first time James and Darnell interact (Darnell taps on James' window to get his attention and James thinks he's being robbed), but the film quickly forgoes that element of social satire in order to maximize its time for desperately unfunny humor."
Get Hard,"By now, you know if you want to see ""Get Hard"" or not, and if you do, that's your own prerogative. This is another one of those films so tailor-made for the lowest common denominator where, much like most Happy Madison films, those who made the film have a lower impression of those who will see the film than you ever could of the film. When you see ""Get Hard,"" just know that it and its creators stoop to a level of condescending none of us can begin to understand."
Get Hard,"Successful investment broker James (Will Ferrell) is given 10 years in San Quentin for fraud, with 30 days to get his affairs in order beforehand. Knowing that he will be unable to survive the experience, he hires his black jailbird car cleaner Darnell (Kevin Hart) to toughen him up beforehand. What he doesn't know is that Darnell has never been near a prison."
Get Hard,"Will Ferrell is a tall white man and Kevin Hart is a short black man, and the height differential between the tall soft white man and the short aggressive black man is quite a good sight gag. Leaving that to one side for the moment, I admire Will Ferrell's talent but don't like very much of what he does, and I'm not overly familiar with Kevin Hart apart from the fact that I get the impression that he appears to come from the Martin Lawrence school of aggressive, shouty ""comedy"", so I wasn't expecting great things. And my expectations were born out in the early stages of this film. Predicated upon a contradictory scenario of an extremely stupid man who has made a lot of money by being extremely smart, with humour which otherwise consists mainly of shouting prodigious quantities of profanity and numerous ""jokes"" about homosexual anal rape, the young audience in the cinema laughed and I didn't."
Get Hard,"The middle section - the toughening up boot camp section - was still shouty, sweary, and full of anal rape jokes, but contained some decent moments where the two characters start to bond somewhat. And the final section, where they finally seek to find the evidence necessary to clear James and put the real villain behind bars was actually quite good."
Get Hard,"Accordingly, this was better than I expected it to be. But its real audience is people who like sweary anal rape jokes."
Get Hard,"Will Ferrell is one of my favourite actors but this has to be a low point in his career. 'Get Hard' is disappointing by any standards, but the fact that one of the best comedy actors in Ferrell is effectively wasted in such a dumb film makes it even worse. 'Get Hard' is some seriously crap material."
Get Hard,"There are some funny scenes in this film, most of them towards the end, but this is down to the actors alone and not the material. Ferrell and Hart and two naturally funny people who have an effortless ability to make people laugh and they are the only thing about this film that makes it remotely watchable. If two less talented actors worked with this material, it would have been a train wreck."
Get Hard,"Will Ferrell is an acquired taste. Either you like his humor, his ability to just ""go for it"" or you don't. Such is the case with GET HARD. If you like Ferrell, you'll like this movie. If you don't, don't waste your time."
Get Hard,"The surprise to me, in this movie, was Kevin Hart. He, basically, is the star of this movie with Ferrell playing the straight man. That is, until Ferrell ""breaks loose."" Which means the first 3/5 of the movie is Hart's - and he hold our attention, and the humor, quite well."
Get Hard,"But it is in a scene about 3/5 of the way in the movie that Ferrell finally lets go - and he lets go in one of the funniest sequences I have ever scene. I cannot describe the scene here for it is VERY politically incorrect, VERY adult and VERY funny. This scene is worth the price of admission alone."
Get Hard,"I turn into about a 14 year old kid when Ferrell is at the top of his game, and - at times - he is in this movie with Hart providing enough backup humor to make this flick worth watching."
Get Hard,7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)
Get Hard,"""Get Hard"" is a very simple title for this 100-minute movie from last year and it is also a very simple film I dare say. Don't be fooled by the director's name, he has nothing to do with the Coen Bros. And what I find the most shocking here is the number of writers who worked on this project. How can so many people not realize that the script is pretty bad and try to improve it. Oh well.. I guess they did and just couldn't do anything about it as they don't have the talent. You cannot really blame lead actors Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart as it is basically impossible to turn this screenplay into a quality movie, no matter how good their performances would be. Not that they were particularly good though."
Get Hard,"I believe this film is just another from in the endless amount of films that exist out there and were really only made to get some cash and not with any creative ambition at all. I am almost a bit embarrassed to say that I somewhat liked the idea of a rich white man who has to go to jail and a black man trying to get him ready for it, even if it is all very absurd of course. There was some comedic potential in here and I believe a skilled writer could have turned this into a decent watch. But he would need to be way better than the people who worked on this one here. I just hope they won't make a sequel anytime soon, no idea if this was successful enough commercially, but if so, they will for sure. That's how it works sadly. I don't care about it though. ""Get Hard"" was a really weak film. Stay away."
Mortdecai,"People have described it as a bit of Pink Panther thing. Which I guess will be OK for Johnny Depp. Because it's not far off and maybe the Captain Jack Sparrow comparisons will stop (probably not, but you can always hope can't you?). One thing is for sure, comedy is always something that will and can divide people easily. What some consider hilarious others will just dismiss as bad or annoying (or maybe something worse)."
Mortdecai,"The mustache jokes will either delight you or not, but we do have a lot of adult situations here, even without going too far down that drain/road. Paltrow relishing in her role as is Law, who can relax for once and sit back and be somebody else (read: not that confident guy). It's a light affair (no pun intended), but if you are willing to let your guard down, you can have fun with it"
Mortdecai,"Adapted from the book anthology by the same name written by Kyril Bonfiglioli, 'Mortdecai' is silly fun! Though never hilarious, this recent box-office disappoint isn't entirely bad either."
Mortdecai,"'Mortdecai' Synopsis: Juggling angry Russians, the British Mi5, and an international terrorist, debonair art dealer and part time rogue Charlie Mortdecai races to recover a stolen painting rumored to contain a code that leads to lost Nazi gold."
Mortdecai,"'Mortdecai' needed more wit & humor, no doubt. But what is served in this action-comedy, isn't unbearable. Some of it actually works, as the bumbling protagonist gets into a series of wacky moments. Even the supporting characters are fairly appealing. But, in totality, I wanted to laugh more."
Mortdecai,"Eric Aronson's Screenplay is continuously silly & on-track, but not foolproof. David Koepp's Direction is impressive. So is the Cinematography. The Editing, however, lacks sharpness. Costume Design & Action-Sequences, are fair."
Mortdecai,"Performance-Wise: Johnny Depp as Mortdecai, is in good goofy mode. The versatile actor seems to be enjoying himself, although his talent is much above a film such as this. Ewan McGregor is first-rate. Gwyneth Paltrow looks aged & tired here. Paul Bettany has his moments. Olivia Munn is seductive. Jeff Goldblum appears in a cameo."
Mortdecai,"On the whole, 'Mortdecai' won't make you fall of your seat with laughter, nor will it want you to pull your hair in anger. Its strictly a one-time watch."
Mortdecai,I saw this movie with my family a few years ago because of Depp and McGregor and we all ended up laughing the whole time and enjoying it. I'm not saying it's up for best picture or anything but it's certainly a movie you can pop in and get some laughs out of.
Mortdecai,"Mortdecai is a good movie with a well written plot and a terrific comedic cast. The chemistry between the cast members is without a doubt what makes it so enjoyable for me. Johnny Depp, Paul Bettany, Gwyneth Paltrow and Ewan McGregor all have great individual chemistry with one another, I particularly liked how Depp and Bettany played off each other. They all fit in to this universe very naturally and effectively."
Mortdecai,"The humour did have its weaknesses, it had far too many running gags that it kept going back to, despite not being all that funny in the first place. Particularly the constant jokes about Mortdecai's moustache were quite repetitive."
Mortdecai,"The characters are also underdeveloped, we learn significantly little about them prior to their adventure beginning. I definitely would like to have learned more about Mortdecai and Johanna's marriage, as well as Jock's personal life."
Mortdecai,"It aims to be a very different, unique comedy, it's style and pacing is not typical, while many people will not agree with me, I thought it achieved this. While it is flawed, Mortdecai is great fun and worth the watch if you are looking for a good comedy, just do not go out pf your way to see it."
Mortdecai,An art dealer rushes to find a valuable painting before it gets in to the wrong hands.
Mortdecai,Best Performance: Johnny Depp / Worst Performance: Olivia Munn
Mortdecai,"Mortdecai is one of those films that you'll love it or hate it. I really was entertained by it, the movie itself is a fun ride, it never tries to be anything more. Johnny Depp's funny performance is a cross between Cary Grant and Peter Sellers, like he does with the Pirate films, he milks it for all it's worth. Unlike his last two films, this was entertaining."
Mortdecai,"The movie is comedic mystery, it has some share of suspense, but it never wavers from that it his still a comedy. Paul Bettany is also quite good has Mortdecai man servant. I clearly see they are both having fun, there almost like a comedy team. All the other supporting cast like Gwyneth Paltrow and Ewan McGregor. Don't go in this expecting much, just a fun time."
Mortdecai,Why so much bad press over an American movie filled with British humor? The negative reviews apparently all come from people in the united states... weirdos.
Mortdecai,"I saw this movie last night; and liked it. For some reason, the children that seem to make up the American audience these days, seem to think that it's a stupid movie. Why? A few days ago, I saw Kingsman: The Secret Service, the film adaptation of a comic mini-series, and thought it was excellent. Look at the rating for Kingsman; it's way higher than this film. Yet, it seems only because Mortdecai is mostly VERY British humor; different than what yanks are used to."
Mortdecai,"I'm glad I saw Mortdecai; I left the cinema feeling pleasant and entertained. Give it an honest try, it's not junk."
Mortdecai,"Jock's response for most of the time is ""I don't know, sir"". Just like my answer to a question, whether the film will be good based on watching the trailer. Well, it turns out once again that I should trust Johnny Depp and expect a good film because that is how Mortdecai turned out."
Mortdecai,"Mortdecai revolves around a rogue art dealer Lord Charlie Mortdecai, struggling to keep his fortune and estate. While being away from his wife he decides to grow a moustache, which becomes an annoying characteristic to everyone in his presence. Meanwhile a woman working on a restoration of a Goya painting is killed and Charlie as an art expert is called for help to retrieve the painting. Many different and strange parties are after this painting, because it is believed it contains a way to find lost Nazi golden treasure."
Mortdecai,"Even though I have given a plot summary there is not much plot in the film, but don't be alarmed. If you recall the Peter Sellers starring The Pink Panther comedies then you might remember that those films also had minimum plot. The basic premise was there only to serve as a creator of situation, a mere thread upon which the scenes could be hanged. The film struggles at first to find its style of humor, but it succeeding at bringing back the aesthetic and style of the Pink Panther films which results in a very pleasant enjoyable comedy. That is all I wanted from this film."
Mortdecai,"The second part of the film, when it shifts into USA is just laugh out loud funny from start to finish. The film suffers from predictability though. I figured the location of the painting before the characters did. It is indirectly implied so that made it easier. Another problem is this film has an R rating but it doesn't really need one. Yes, there are two utterances of the F-word but otherwise it is a film suitable for the whole family (Considering that your kids are teenagers now in order for them to get all the jokes). There is nothing explicit so the best decision in order to get more money at the box office would be to obtain the PG-13 rating since lot of Depp's fans are teenagers as well, now unable to see the film."
Mortdecai,I have always enjoyed the master/servant dynamic in films ant TV series. It usually present in British culture. The best example would be Blackadder where this master/servant relationship is utterly genius. So it goes to say that best character is not the titular character but his servant Jock. He steals every scene he is in and Bettany and Depp have amazing chemistry and play off each other quite nicely. Paltrow and Depp make a nice duo as well despite not sharing much time together. For example the gag reflex during kissing caused by the moustache is a brilliant joke.
Mortdecai,"Geoff Zanelli, a frequent Koepp's collaborator never disappoints but I feel like he can't ever top Secret Window score which is simply magnificent. The end credits song simply titled Johanna, which is a result of a collaboration of Zanelli, Mark Ronson and Miles Kane is a sweet song. A fitting end to cap this film. I have ended up listening it on repeat. It is a song made in a way in which they are not made anymore. An old fashioned tune that soothes my ears."
Mortdecai,"To point out something interesting I noticed Charlie is not much of the hero of the story in the sense that he is not controlling what is happening around him. He is manipulated by almost everyone – his wife, his servant, Goldblum's art dealer, the MI5. It is very interesting to have a main character, who is absolutely in no control of his destiny."
Mortdecai,"Mortdecai is a great enjoyable comedy for everyone who simply wants to have fun, relax and have a good time. Despite its predictability it delivers a great enjoyment, it delivers a comedy like which is not being made anymore."
Mortdecai,"I do understand that people don't have the same taste of movies etc. It's everyone's right to have a different opinion about anything. For me it is simple, the people that didn't like this movie are just people I try to avoid because of their lack of humor and taste. And they will probably try to avoid me as well. That's just how it is. Some people just don't have any good taste. To me giving Mortdecai a bad review is just ridiculous. I really enjoyed the posh sophisticated language of Mortdecai. I thought it was very funny. Johnny Depp was just the perfect actor for this role. He's just outstanding playing Mortdecai. The action might be a little bit over the top but that is just the only bad thing about this movie. And it's not even that bad. The whole cast was just perfect in this movie. To me Mortdecai is one of the better movies I saw this month, and I watch a lot of movies. I just feel sorry for people with no sense of humor, must be really boring living with them."
Mortdecai,"Despite what reviews say, yes some Americans actually truly love this movie. It came out at a time when audiences were maybe kind of sick of Depp at the time and his reputation was being dragged through the mud, and the trailer sucked."
Mortdecai,"In reality, this is a delightful, hilarious movie that I have watched over and over again. It's like a comfort food movie for me. I'll throw it on at the end of the night and fall asleep to it all the time. I put it on if I'm depressed and need something silly to make me feel good."
Mortdecai,"No it's not a flawless movie but it is one of my favorites. It makes me laugh every single time and if you haven't given it a chance, you should. No you probably won't love it as much as me but you probably won't hate it as much as you might expect either."
Mortdecai,"Writer/Director David Koepp's bright n' breezy, screwball comedy is a consistently effervescing delight, greatly enlivened with one of Johnny Depp's most engagingly eccentric characters, the recently moustachioed, unrepentantly shady art dealer Charlie Mortdecai, a valiantly verbose, self-centred rogue whose adoration of his delightful wife is matched by a no less ardent dislike of policeman Ewan McGregor who all too reluctantly hires the magnificently foppish Mortdecai to assist him in locating a rare, recently stolen artwork, which is the initially sedate catalyst for a genuinely funny, frequently ludicrous Blake Edwards-style, high-octane farce, with the woefully inept, but eminently charming dilettante Mortdecai flamboyantly free-falling through a majestic multitude of pan-continental mishaps, fighting to keep hold of his beloved 'stach as his loyally twin-fisted, enthusiastically libidinous manservant Jock stoically battles with the myriad ill-humoured thugs and multitudinously evil menaces borne of his globe-galavanting master's misguided machinations, and woolly-headed, wonderfully wrong-footed chicanery! 'Mortdecai' is an impeccably acted, perfectly silly old school slapstick, pratfall-filled comedy with a nimble, whimsically witty script, likeable, colourfully rendered performances, all zestfully orchestrated by Koepp who credibly coaxes one of the more entertainingly squirrelly, sublimely screwball, knock-about kooky characters from the delightfully quixotic actor Johnny Depp."
Mortdecai,"Lord Charlie Mortdecai is a rather seedy minor noble, an art specialist with a stately manor to maintain, and wondering what to do with a rather large tax bill. Consequently he has little choice but to get involved in a caper involving a restored Goya painting."
Mortdecai,"I fell up the steps as this film started, and spent the first ten minutes doing my best not to throw up at the pain in my knee, added to which I knew from the trailer that I was in for one of Johnny Depp's makeup, mannerisms and funny voice performances, which have rather outstayed their welcome as their number has increased. And, looking at reviews on the IMDb, it is clear that this movie has, indeed, annoyed and irritated a number of viewers: I fully expected to join their ranks."
Mortdecai,"And I loved it. There was me and an older couple in the cinema, and all three of us laughed out loud quite often. The film is very, very silly, and it tickled my funnybone considerably. I especially liked Paul Bettany's assistant/henchman Jock, and the transitions between locations were nicely done."
Mortdecai,"This is not going to please everyone, but it took my mind off my agonising knee very effectively."
Mortdecai,"This movie actually made me register with IMDb to publish my displeasure. I've read the reviews here and typically they're from art house aficionados who sooooo want everything to have meaning. News flash, sometimes a movie is just a movie and sometimes humour is unsophisticated. Get over it."
Mortdecai,"Johnny Depp seems to be a target for these reviewers at the moment. I found his performance/homage to Terry Thomas ""rather good"". The various cameos and supporting performances were also ""rather good"" The film is soaked in British humour and I can see how some from the ""colonies"" just don't get it but for people to give this 1 or 2 out of 10 is beyond belief."
Mortdecai,"-Mortdecai (2015) movie review: -Mortdecai is a comedy(ish) film that sees Johnny Depp as Mortdecai, an exaggerated art dealer who is tasked with finding a valuable painting that was stolen. And of course, antics and odd scenarios ensue."
Mortdecai,"-As poorly as the film did at the box office, I feel like the bad rep the film has is lightly uncalled for after seeing it. Doesn't make it a great film or anything, but it was not too bad."
Mortdecai,"-The story is very classic, goofy detective inspired, which was interesting and offered a few twists, but was really nothing new."
Mortdecai,-The pace was alittle too fast I think. It moved quickly and could have taken its time in a few places.
Mortdecai,"-I'll get this out of the way before acting: The entire film is super goofy and cheesy. Like cartoon goofy. It did match the pace and story, but if you are not into films that are intentionally silly, yeah."
Mortdecai,"-The acting is goofy. I also feel like nobody, from Johnny Depp's weird character with a mustache, Ewan McGregor's cool, yet dumb detective, or Gwyneth Paltrow's mellow wife character. So nobody really needed to try that hard because of the goofy characters and typecasting."
Mortdecai,"-The characters are all shallow, but fun to watch."
Mortdecai,"-The music is really repetitive, but I thought it was fun and fitting."
Mortdecai,"-The film as a whole was not too funny, but had a few moments that did really make me laugh. It had some moments that surprised me with entertainment value as well, although a few that did not."
Mortdecai,"-Mortdecai is also apparently rated-R, but does not need to be, in my opinion. It has next-to-no violence, no actual nudity, some suggestive dialogue, and I think 2 F-words. Sounds like a strong PG-13 to me."
Mortdecai,"-Mortdecai is fun and entertaining, but super cheesy and goofy. If you are into fun, goofy, spy-ish comedy-ish movies though, I will say Mortdecai is worth watching on Netflix!"
Mortdecai,"I could almost name this movie as a parody to the 007 genre but I won't do it because I think this is so much more than that. Johnny Depp once again shows us a character that if done by someone else would be quickly forgotten, but his way of acting makes us believe in the character and laugh with it."
Mortdecai,"The story, the scenery and even the Rolls Royce was a nice selection to a movie that so many people apparently don't understand what it is. Those who do appreciate the constant innuendos and the carefully executed humorous gags do have some fun throughout the movie and know ""everything will be OK in the end!"""
Mortdecai,Is it worth watching? Absolutely!
Mortdecai,"I thought it was funny, so there! Clearly it is a satire on British upper class as well as a spoof on action films with one preposterous and improbable scenario after another. But surely, no less improbable and preposterous scenarios found in the Bond Franchise."
Mortdecai,"Depp's take on acttor Terry Thomas was spot on. Gwyneth Paltrow asking "" Whom exactly"" is Depp's mustache attractive, immediately strikes the English ear as ""off"" and clearly intended as commentary on the formal ""To whom did you wish to speak"" vs. The colloquial ""To who do you wish to speak?""
It was funny and suspenseful at the same ...."
Mortdecai,"I was moved to write my first ever IMDb review because of the amount of derision heaped on this film by mainly American reviewers. This mountain of vitriol almost stopped me from going to see the film; how glad I am that I stuck to my decision to see it! Johnny Depp, for me, is always good value, and is an actor who seems to be unafraid of challenging not only himself but we, the audience, too. His portrayal of Charlie Mortdecai was based not so much on Ralph Fiennes' M.Gustave, but more on characters from The Fast Show and various Upper Class Twits from the classic Monty Python sketch. Indeed, as a massive fan of The Fast Show (he appeared in the final episode) I'm fairly sure that Mr Depp had some influence in securing the comic genius of Paul Whitehouse to play Spinoza. After reading the host of bad reviews I entered the cinema with some trepidation, but was rewarded with a well-written, smoothly-directed, fast-paced concoction which ticked plenty of boxes for me; I did start to wonder if I was watching the same film that some other reviewers watched. Perhaps the humour was just ""too English"" for some of our friends in the ""far colonies""! Please don't be put off by the large number of bad reviews; Mortdecai was well worth the price of entry!"
Mortdecai,"Seriously, I can't believe how upset people are with this movie; I couldn't even breathe anymore as I walked out of the theater after laughing a lot! Yeah the jokes are stupid, the acting is over-the-top, the story isn't that brilliant and there isn't any deep sh*t plot twist but really, who watches comedy and expect something that will make them contemplate about life??? In terms of entertainment, this movie certainly delivers... Unless of course you're a frigging hipster who can't appreciate any movie that doesn't f*ck your brains out. Come on, Birdman for instance received a lot of good feedback but it's not that funny -- it's just deep. And artsy. It seems the trend these days; if a movie's storyline is plain enough for the layman to understand, these know-it-all guys will say it's horrible, waste of time, blah blah..."
Mortdecai,"There's a lot of movies far worse than this and I don't understand all the hate on this one; probably because it stars Johnny Depp (who was amazing as always, by the way) and they just expect too much. Whatever! Loosen up, guys!"
Mortdecai,"This movie made me laugh, buy it's not exciting enough to see it more than once."
Mortdecai,"The mustache, Mortdecai's pride and charm, it's a trademark funny element reminiscent of the 70's detective shows. Which makes sense because this movie's screenplay is an adaptation of the 70's British Mortdecai book series. Indeed, the settings, the characters and the tone of this film brings memories of 70's TV shows I grew up watching. Do you remember Cool McCool cartoons, Don Adam's Maxwell Smart in Get Smart, and Inspector Clouseau in Pink Panther? Also, the dynamics between Mortdecai and his manservant Jock, remind me of the British comedy Wooster and Jeeves."
Mortdecai,"I immediately liked that picaresque art dealer—charming, sophisticated, coward at times, and with very peculiar and expensive tastes. Mortdecai is an eccentric with many flaws—but he is a gentleman, capable of kindness. Often times, he inadvertently causes all sorts of wrecks and injuries. Johnny Depp pours all his vibrant JohnnyDepp-ness into his character: the attitudes and expressions and gestures and mannerisms are all great and funny."
Mortdecai,"This film is no masterpiece but it is certainly entertaining. The dark humor sometimes is silly, but that's the point of parody. There are bits of disgusting things, bits of blood, and bits of vulgarity, but enough jeopardy and suspense throughout Mortdecai's transcontinental adventure."
Mortdecai,"This stolen-painting-crime/comic plot is accompanied by subtle subplots. There's the mild love triangle between the jealous and insecure Mortdecai, his wife (Gwyneth Paltrow), and his college friend the detective (Ewan McGregor). There's the friendship with his utmost super-loyal and smart manservant and body-guard (Paul Bettany). And there's the want-to-be-passionate husband-wife relationship that leaves Mortdecai, a gentleman, bed deprived"
Mortdecai,"I loved seeing Johnny Depp work with Paul Bettany—they make a brilliant team, just like they did too in Transcendence and The Tourist. Gwyneth Paltrow brings such elegance and intelligence. Ewan McGregor plays a charming-and-charmed detective. Jeff Goldblum's short role was great too!"
Mortdecai,"Surely you won't be bored. Play along with the characters. The staging is funny too: the variety of locations and the paintings. The movie begins with a certain hilarious painting in the background, and ends with the same painting."
Mortdecai,Give it a go!
Mortdecai,Enjoy. Cheers.
Mortdecai,My Thoughts:
Mortdecai,"Wow where to begin with this movie. When I first started seeing the trailers for this movie I was intrigued and worried. I was intrigued cause this looked like an unusual but interesting movie. My worry came from seeing Mr. Johnny Depp playing another character role and this worried me because in my opinion Johnny Depp has been cashing in on his Jack Sparrow character from the Pirate of the Caribbean movies for the past what 10 plus years now. But I am glad to say that the Mortdecai character stands on his own, yes you could see little flares of Sparrowness in him but over all this character stood on its own."
Mortdecai,Let me tell you that all the actors in this movie did a fantastic job. But I have to say that Jock (Paul Bettany) was great to watch. Jock is Mortdecai's Man Servant and jack of all trades and without him Mortdecai would not survive a day on his own. Ewan McGregor and Gwyneth Paltrow both shine in their roles as well and think they did a wonderful job in the supporting roles.
Mortdecai,"Another thing I loved about this movie was the little travel scenes between cities. It kind of reminded me of the old school Indiana Jones plane cut scenes but updated. I also loved a lot of the cinematography in this movie as well, there was bright colors and sweeping wide screen shots that complimented this movie really well."
Mortdecai,This movie is not going to be for everyone though it is a strange quirky comedy and has some ludicrous moments. But as one of my friends said when we walked out of the screening this has that sort of Pink Panther feel and I have to agree this movie follows along those same lines.
Mortdecai,My Recommendation:
Mortdecai,Looking for a different change of pace and a quirky movie then this is for you.
Mortdecai,"Do you possess intelligence? If you do, this is your comedy. Johnny Depp is absolutely brilliant here. The rest of the cast accomplishes their task as well. The critics reviews were savage. This movie lost money at the box office. Ignore all that. The movie was over their heads. If you're stupid, and have no sense, please don't watch this movie. You won't get it. If you're an intelligent person, and possess a sense of humor, you will delight as you watch this film."
Mortdecai,After a long time I saw a comedy movie in which I actually laughed. I fail to understand the issue some of the people have with this film. Probably because these are the sort of people who enjoy spoofs and think only those films are comedy.
Mortdecai,The movie was hilarious. The casting brilliant. The acting spot on. Not every movies story line needs to be the great American comedy. But this does pretty well. Some comedies can linger on the scenes making it boring. But the timing in this film was great and it had me laughing throughout.
Mortdecai,"Not a particularly great fan of Jhonny Depps outside the pirates of the Caribbean franchise. So when I saw how he played Mortdecai's character, I enjoyed it to no end."
Mortdecai,"Johnny Depp has long predicated his acting career off of doing his own thing and not particularly caring what audiences or the general consensus of his performances or mannerisms are. Ever since the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise, Depp has continuously been giving headlining roles in projects with enormous budgets that have either barely broke even, went on to be record box office bombs, or simply withered away without anything of a pop culture impact. His last few films, ""The Rum Diary,"" ""Dark Shadows,"" ""The Lone Ranger,"" and ""Transcendence"" all have put up meager numbers at the box office when compared to their respective budgets, but, for whatever reason, financiers and movie studios still funnel money towards Depp's films, with or without any franchise history."
Mortdecai,"If his latest picture, David Koepp's ""Mortdecai,"" after the horribly negative critical/audience backlash and the catastrophic earnings on its opening weekend, doesn't at least prevent us from seeing another lofty, big-budget Depp film in the next two years, I'm convinced nothing will. ""Mortdecai"" is a $60 million travesty, not including the money it took to market such a horrendous cinematic miscalculation. Other than to give critics and hardened film fans an early pick for their worst film of the year, I'm not particularly sure why the film was made, or why and how Lionsgate is going to manage to get a franchise out of such a contemptible titular character and a droll, misguided story."
Mortdecai,"Depp plays Lord Charlie Mortdecai, an eccentric art dealer who can't keep his hands off his curly mustache, a feature he boasts to fall in line with the other Mortdecai men of past generations and something that serves as an incessant running gag throughout the whole film. Obsessed with his mustache, his gorgeous wife Johanna (Gwyneth Paltrow), and whilst running into trouble at every turn, Mortdecai must travel all around the world to discover a stolen painting said to have a code to a lost bank account that is filled with stolen Nazi gold. The only one constantly by his side is Jock Strapp (Paul Bettany), his trusty protector who does whatever he can to assure the safety of his friend, even if that means taking a bullet for the poor soul on several different occasions, usually as a result of Mortdecai's own personal error."
Mortdecai,"""Mortdecai"" is what I call a ""storm cloud film,"" in that something about the very first scene, its presentation, its characters, the delivery of the dialog, and the first series of unfolding events do not add up. Something feels off or unsettled about the production, and one begins to fear if they're in for a mediocre or downright awful event, despite quietly hoping the film turns around or gains some sort of balance. I kept wishing ""Mortdecai"" would go from stumbling to at least being able to strut with some control, but such optimism was foolish. How could writer Eric Aronson, director David Koepp, responsible for such great films as ""Premium Rush"" and ""The Trigger Effect,"" and producer Johnny Depp be a part of something so catastrophic and desperately unfunny? The film functions in such a way that leads one to believe Aronson took down a list of humorous scenarios to trap his lead character in before constructing them and robbing them of any and all things funny."
Mortdecai,"Depp traverses one continent after another, going from one brightly-colored setpiece to the next, delivering an endless bout of redundant dialog that is definitely something but that something isn't the least bit funny. It's exhaustive and aggressively silly, proving time and time again that if you make a film about a character who cannot take himself seriously, in turn, audiences will not be able to take the film seriously and dismiss it on-sight. Being that the film is constructed so much around Mortdecai, his personality, and his ability to either say the darnedest thing or find himself in every sticky situation imaginable, once one discovers that the titular character is a poorly-constructed, unfunny bore, the film has already crashed and burned because it put so much of its reliance and weight of its success on said character."
Mortdecai,"The storyline here is enough to drive you mad, not because it's confusing, but it's restless and often interrupted by a legion of weakly-written supporting roles from the likes of great actors like Olivia Munn and Ewan McGregor. The film zig-zags around enough that any clean, linear form of a plot is lost immediately, and the fact that constant silliness is being paraded around screen from Depp's character or an anti-climactic, buffoonish car chase shreds any kind of interest at all in the story at hand. At this point, the film has effectively given us an insufferable character lead character and a disorganized mess of a plot that can't help but interrupt itself; once you have a film destroy its two pioneering elements, all you have left are aesthetics, and so very few films have gotten by on those principles alone. The aesthetics of the film are beautiful, with cinematographical work by Florian Hoffmeister shining through, as this is a candy-colored affair; the fact that ""Mortdecai"" puts little emphasis on environments and I'm commending the cinematography shows how desperate I was to try and find something on screen that interested me. This is one of the worst, most grating cinematic experiences I've had in recent memory."
Mortdecai,"No one said that this movie was aiming for anything else than having a good time watching it.My guess is that everybody that disliked the film never liked Inspector Clouseau for example, or Indiana Jones movies. It is fairly obvious that Clouseau and Kato are Mortdecai & Joki in this one, minus Clouseau's unshakeable trust to his police force skills.Lord Charlie never gets as cocky in front of his ""team"" of spouse and male servant, for nothing more than his good taste and hideous moustache that surely reminds us of his noble background and also provides some good laughs. It is his ""pipe and hat"", or ""whip and hat"", if you prefer, his trademark appearance set. It is fairly obvious that the screenwriters and director tried to reference the opening scene with Temple Of Doom. Lord Mortdecai is a kind of Indiana Jones in the art business, finding lost paintings e.t.c., minus the naive US perspective of a morally right hero. He is a British Lord after all, thus corrupted, pompous and easily sold out to the highest bidder, due to personal debts created by the excesses of luxury and pretentious/decandant aristocratic way of life. Anyway, enough with the U.S. haters, that simply don't get it. In order of an American getting it, the dialogues should have been filled with gangsta rap slang..Then and only then, the joke would be obvious. Now, with this posh dialect and witty selections of words (like using a thesaurus) they should try to understand what's been said, than just laugh with the out-of-context, expressions such as ""yeah"", ""biatch"", ""sista"". African Americans are still used by/for white ignorance and it seems that it is fairly impossible for Americans to get anything funny that isn't in their cultural status, even if this foreign cultural element rather aims to ridicule itself, than seriously impose on any other culture. Americans must felt offended by Charlie's visit in the US or from quotes like: ""have we taken a wrong turn and arrived to a set of a pornographic film?"", while they were checking in a hotel, because I just can't otherwise understand their dislike to this film. It seems that Quentin alone can't persuade the American audience of the virtues of well written dialogues with unusual vocabulary choices. Now tell me, which is more preferable: ""son of a wh..re"" or Charlie's line addressing one of his abusers: ""your mother and father only met once and money changed hands..propably less than a 20"".. David Coepp is a successful screenplay writer, and a fair director, his all star cast performs the way they should be, and are at points hilarious, the plot is fairly twisting... I just can't understand why Depp is not as good as Sparrow, or Paltrow not as good as Iron Man's Potts, or Mc Gregor not as good as Obi-Wan. You might say that only Bettany provides a performance lesser of what expected of him, but that should be rather credited to the screenplay, or the role itself, than his effort which is adequate. The soundtrack contains one of the coolest songs in a movie (Johanna feat. MIles Kane). It is simply one of the best movies for the start of 2015. In the universe of trendy sequels this movie could easily provide a franchise similar to Edward's Pink Panther for the new millenia, much more successful than the American reboot of the series (with the god Steve Martin). I wanted to rank it even higher but I considered this unfair to other movies that are interested in achieving something greater than two hours of fun. If you don't get it, don't hate it!!"
Mortdecai,"I don't understand the bad reviews, I thought it was hilarious. Depp's best character yet. I love silly, witty dialogue and this is chock full of it. It doesn't hurt that it is also visually gorgeous. Love the Rolls!"
Mortdecai,"I just got back from seeing this and it's honestly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I knew it wasn't going to be brilliant, but I like Johnny Depp and thought it would be at least a fun, bumbling action-comedy, a genre that is a 'guilty pleasure' of mine. It's hard to decide where to start when pointing out the flaws of a dreadful movie like this, but I'll first start by saying that the writing is horrendous. The lazy writers decided to use the same jokes not once, not twice, but several times because they can't think of anything better to write! The line 'show me your balls' is used at least 3-5 times and while it was sort of funny the first time, it starts to get INCREDIBLY tedious and repetitive after that. The same goes with Mortdecai's wife gagging when they try to kiss. That happens 3-5 times as well and is even the final shot of the movie as well! The rest of the humor is mostly slapstick-based, which would have been fine if it wasn't so painfully obvious what was coming. For example, in one scene Mortdecai is sword fighting a man and he ends up on the ground with a large box suspended from a wire up above. The man takes the sword and cuts the rope and the box almost 'traps' Mortdecai. And in one ridiculous scene when the writers didn't know how to end it, people attending a party with food poisoned by the villain, despite being in plain view of the villain poisoning the food, eat it and vomit profusely, including onto a moving car's windshield. The remaining jokes are painfully dumb as well and are basically showcases of the complete stupidity of Mortdecai's character. For example, he walks into a hotel in Los Angeles and sees people in bikinis and claims that he accidentally went to the set of a porno. Then he checks in at the reception desk and gets handed a room key and claims that the U.S. is in financial troubles because anyone who checks in at a hotel receives a credit card like he supposedly just did. The story is really dull and never really comes together, and even worse, the so-called twist can be guessed miles away. Overall, ""Mortdecai"" is an embarrassingly bad comedy that tries to be funny, but the horrible quality of the movie is the real joke. One of the worst movies I've ever seen!"
"McFarland, USA","Okay, Kevin Costner can do this character in his sleep. His ""Coach/Manager/Player who has seen it all"" character is standard stuff for him. It's basically ""Bull Durham"", ""Draft Day"", ""For Love of the Game"" all rolled into the same guy. That's not a bad thing. I like him in those roles. It's just nothing new. What's surprising is the plethora of fabulous performances by the kids and townspeople in this terrific little TRUE story. They ROCK this picture. Special recognition to the set designers who created a beautiful location for all the running sequences. It was a rich assortment of landscapes that mesmerized the visual senses on BluRay."
"McFarland, USA","Basic plot: Costner (Jim White) is a football coach at a reasonably successful high school program. Because of a mistake in the opening sequence, the coach is fired and lands in a dead-end town in Nowhere'sville, USA - aka McFarland, CA. The fish-out-of-water family has a few brushes with the local Mexican population where they think being the only (seemingly) white family in the area is a bad idea and are intending on moving immediately. Then Costner sees a kid running a sub-5-minute mile on his way to work in the produce fields with the rest of the population of minority workers in the area. What follows is fairly standard Disney stuff of our innocent but willing racially-inferior minnows who fight to get better against the racist, elitist killer whales (rich kids) of the other schools. What makes this watchable is how true the story is. Don't get me wrong. There are some formulaic sequences here. But how they pull it off is worth the cinematic journey. For Disney, I'm proud of them for taking a racial theme and turning it into a positive story for all involved."
"McFarland, USA","I have to say the reason I'm giving this a ""7"" is because of the EXCELLENT behind-the-scenes stories where the filmmakers interview the runners from the team, along with the real coach, Jim White, and Kevin Costner all at the same sitting. Hearing them reminiscing (the movie is set in 1989), talking about the movie, and showing genuine care and respect for their beloved coach and each other... It's what a coach could only hope for in the children who grow up to be fine adults. Mr. White created a dynasty of runners that forged an ironclad identity with hope for the future in this nothing town when nobody was giving them a chance. One man can still make a difference on a global scale if you work hard enough. It's inspiring stuff."
"McFarland, USA","The highest praise I can give this movie: My two teenage athlete children (soccer and baseball/softball) who have watched literally hundreds and hundreds of movies were against it. It was Disney for crying out loud. And a movie about CROSS COUNTRY no less. They would rather watch ""Mission Impossible 15"" or anything else. These are seasoned moviephiles. But Dad just wouldn't be denied. ;-) Within the first 15 minutes, they were hooked and enjoyed every minute of the rest of the movie. They even sat through the behind-the-scenes interviews. It was a family experience I won't forget. Well done, Disney."
"McFarland, USA","As a coach myself, this is the kind of stuff that inspires me to work with kids who don't have a future in their current situation. And if you're already a coach, it may open your eyes to kids who have natural talents that may be wasted on something other than where their true skills lie. Much recommended. :-)"
"McFarland, USA",Greetings from Lithuania.
"McFarland, USA","It's hard imagine anyone who would not cheer a bit after watching ""McFarland, USA"" (2015). This is a true story, and the movie is truly good and sometimes moving. It's inspirational story like you have seen many times actually, but it is made so well that at running time 2 h 5 min this movie never drags and is involving from start till finish."
"McFarland, USA","Overall, ""McFarland, USA"" is sometimes routine and familiar, yet very entertaining movie. Kevin Costner is good in here, and although no Oscars will shine with this movie, it's nevertheless a very well made picture. Directing was solid - pacing of this movie is great. Music was nice, as well as cinematography. It's not very original picture, but a very fine one."
"McFarland, USA","I've seen this film a few times, and again today after a long time. I can't get bored of it. A story about commitment, dreams, not giving up, family and sport. Excellent biopic with great directing, writing and performances. These type of films are right up Costner's alley."
"McFarland, USA",Track coach Jim White is a newcomer to a predominantly Latino high-school in California's Central Valley.
"McFarland, USA","Coach White and his new students find that they have much to learn about one another, but things begin to change when White realises the boys' exceptional running ability."
"McFarland, USA","More than just physical prowess drives the teens to succeed. Their strong family ties, incredible work ethic and commitment to their team all play a factor in forging these novice runners into champions......."
"McFarland, USA","Sports movies featuring Kevin Costner are the cinematic equivalent of Cheese on Toast. You've had it before, numerous times, and you know what exactly what you are going to get. But too much of the stuff isn't too good for you."
"McFarland, USA","I'm a big Kevin Costner champion, he's always been a big screen presence, and even though he's had his shortcomings (The Postman was almost career suicide, but WaterWorld was not, I repeat, was not a flop) he still makes an ordinary film that little bit more extraordinary, because he just has that effortless class about him."
"McFarland, USA","As you'd expect, the films narrative is as predictable as day turns to night."
"McFarland, USA","White joins a school that isn't the best in the world. He sees potential in a few students, and learns of their hardship, he forms a cross country team, much to the frustration of family, colleagues. They get mocked by the river, better school, and fail their first attempt."
"McFarland, USA","Them there is a big montage, the voice of the group has a hissy fit, goes home and fights with his family. Costner bumps into him, they a have a conversation, and you know what? he rejoins the team and they do much better, and decide to have a party. After all the people Costner was alienated against at first have formed a big bond with him and his family, and all is well."
"McFarland, USA","But then something happens, Costner loses faith and then it's his turn to have a conversation with the student. You can pretty much guess the rest."
"McFarland, USA","It's a safe film for sure. The true story of a struggling group of sports people has been done to death, from Cool Runnings to Remember The Titans, it's a paint by numbers narrative that hasn't, and probably never will be be changed."
"McFarland, USA",Because it always works.
"McFarland, USA","Costner is fantastic as always, and although it will disappear without a trace, it's one of those films that will appear on TV one Sunday afternoon, you will come across it halfway through, watch it, and know exactly what has happened, and what will happen within a couple of minutes."
"McFarland, USA","It's uplifting stuff, without being too sugar coated, and you get the obligatory clip of the real life people at the end, just in case there are a few doubters in the audience."
"McFarland, USA",Another safe family film from Disney.
"McFarland, USA",I 'lapped' it up.
"McFarland, USA","A coach inspiring a group of underprivileged kids to form a team to beat well-heeled rivals has been done before, but ""McFarland, USA"" does it well."
"McFarland, USA","Set in the 1980's, Jim White (Kevin Costner) takes a job as assistant sports coach at McFarland High, a mainly Hispanic school in Los Angeles. However the area seems too dangerous for his wife and young daughter, while scholastic achievement and prowess on the sporting field are not priorities for the students, many of whom work in the surrounding fields as pickers to help their families."
"McFarland, USA","However when White realises that some of his students are strong runners, he creates a cross-country running team to take on the wealthier schools that dominate the sport. Then as White and his family get to know the people in the area, they feel a sense of belonging, which they hadn't felt before."
"McFarland, USA","The film builds to an emotional, uplifting climax. Although a fair amount of rearranging of the facts took place, it is reassuring to learn that the story is essentially true."
"McFarland, USA","The film gets its message across without being preachy. At the end, when the actors segue into the real people, the theme behind the film becomes clear; if you can engage people and focus them on a goal and build self-esteem then they are more likely to become the citizens you want."
"McFarland, USA",This is a movie that sneaks up on you. Kevin Costner plays it low-key. One can see how an overly effusive approach to teaching would in reality have seemed fake to students wary of anything false.
"McFarland, USA",Maria Bello is perfect as Cheryl Whitel it's not a big role but she lifts any film she is in. Valente Rodriguez almost steals the show as the likable Principal Carmillo.
"McFarland, USA","Long distance running takes on an almost mystical significance in movies. Possibly the link with cross country-running, the endurance required and the sense of achievement it generates was one of the reasons nearly all the boys in Coach White's squad went on to lead meaningful lives."
"McFarland, USA","A football team or a baseball team would also have had a galvanising effect, but endurance sports are different – it could have a lot to do with endorphins cutting in creating a natural high and great self-confidence."
"McFarland, USA",McFarland is a movie with a heart; it's a winner all round.
"McFarland, USA","Greetings again from the darkness. ""A Disney movie"" was once synonymous with good-hearted family fare. Even though the lure of big box office has caused the studio to expand their film boundaries a bit, no one does it better when the material is a heart-warming, inspiring story  especially if based on a true story. This latest has less in common with The Mighty Ducks, and more with Miracle, The Rookie, and Dreamer."
"McFarland, USA","Based on a true story that began in 1987, Kevin Costner plays high school coach Jim White, who after a couple of unfortunate incidents, finds himself with a not so desirable teaching/coaching gig in the San Joaquin Valley in central California – specifically the poverty stricken farming community of McFarland. To say that life is hard in McFarland is a bit of an understatement. The families are mostly Hispanic and heavily dependent on crop picking. Once the kids are age 10, they are put to work in the fields before and after school."
"McFarland, USA","Toting their prejudices, Coach White and his wife (Maria Bello) and two daughters arrive as outsiders, but quickly discover their neighbors are very proud people who value family and community. Coach also discovers that the area boys have developed a natural ability to run distances in the heat, so he forms a school cross country team, and the rest is literally history. The runners dominate the California state meet by winning 9 of the next 14 years, and many of the boys go off to college – something previously not even a remote dream for most."
"McFarland, USA","Since this is Disney, most of the jagged edges are rounded off. Crime, discrimination, politics, racism, and poverty are present, but do not receive much attention. Director Niko Caro (Whale Rider, North Country) does nice work in keeping the story grounded and focused on the individuals. We get a feel for the skepticism and family obstacles faced by this first group of runners. More importantly, we witness the pride and involvement as the boys begin to have some success, and the sense of belonging that sneaks up on White and his family."
"McFarland, USA","Costner does get a shot at a motivational speech, but it's small in scope and wonderfully centered on what the boys have accomplished, rather than some unrelatable shot at changing the world. Seeing him on a ""Barbie"" bike brings a laugh, as does some of the high school boy chatter directed at their duck-out-of-water coach. We don't really get to know the individual boys too much (some are actors, some are actual McFarland students), but the end credit video recap of where they are now (27 years later) really hits home as to the importance of guidance and mentorship for youngsters."
"McFarland, USA",The film is extremely pleasant and the story's roots in the real world lend credence to the inspirational message and underdog-overcoming-obstacles story. It's also a reminder that opportunity to make a difference is all around us. Just look what Jim White and runners have accomplished!
"McFarland, USA","McFarland USA is much more than the regular feel good sports movie. The setting, acting, music, and story line blend perfectly to deliver a heart-warming tale. It is a film that touches all sides of this true story to make it stand out against the rest. By the time it's all done, you will feel like part of the McFarland family."
"McFarland, USA","Kevin Costner plays Jim White, a coach whose anger forces him move to a struggling, McFarland, California, where he begins a job teaching science and gym. In this predominately Latino town Jim and his family experience a culture they hadn't been exposed to in Boise, Idaho. Very early on something about these kids catches Jim's eye, their ability to run. With a little bit of work and convincing of some students and the school administration, Jim creates a cross-country team that he believes, can achieve greatness."
"McFarland, USA","The setting for this movie perfectly captures the feel for McFarland. Featuring plenty of dead grass, roaming dogs, endless fields, and low riders with ridiculous paint jobs, the viewer gets a feel for the town at the very beginning of the movie. Most of the people in this town are migrant workers. The run down buildings, chipping paint, and collapsing school display the poverty level of the town quite clearly. With a prison located across the street from the school, it is made clear that most kids have the choice of going to jail, or working in the fields. While the town is rather plain, the director did a great job of capturing the beautiful mountains and landscapes of the surrounding area. In addition to the beautiful scenery, the music chosen makes it feel like there is a mariachi band right in your room. The setting as a whole was delivered in a way that makes the viewer understand the economic state of the town and the surrounding area, which is a big help in supporting the plot."
"McFarland, USA","Every singe one of the actors in this movie played the role perfectly. I was stunned by the amount of character development in such a short period of time. By the end of the movie, you will feel connected to every character. Kevin Costner seems to be simply playing himself, but Carlos Pratts steals the show with his amazing portrayal of Thomas Valles. During a training session, Thomas has an emotional break down due to the combination of a stressful life at home and the endless cycle of poverty that the people of McFarland can't seem to break. It is here that the crying, shouting, angry voice of Thomas spills all the struggles of the migrant workers and the lives they live. The characters and the writing also allow for some comic relief. A man who's last name is White struggles to pronounce Hispanic names, and the stock character of a chubby Danny Diaz who is trying his best to keep up with the rest of the team."
"McFarland, USA","I'm impressed that the movie didn't contain a crazy amount of over dramatizations, because we all know that is the worst thing in the world. Considering it's a Disney sports movie based on a true story, you should know how it ends before you even watch it. I highly recommend you watch it anyways. It contains scenes that leave your hands sweating and your heart beating, and creates feelings similar to the first time you ever saw the Italian Stallion beat Apollo Creed in the ring. When it's all said and done, the town of McFarland, and especially its cross-country team, will hold a special place in your heart. Before you watch this movie, make sure your mom signs the permission slip, because you're about to go on a feel trip."
"McFarland, USA","After a million years as an IMDb member I'm finally inspired to write a review. This movie is guileless and sweet in the most beautiful way. Not heavy-handed, no huge buildup over the races (in all aspects of the word), but rather huge focus on interpersonal relationships and the judgments every human makes about one another. There's also huge pride in the small working towns I've personally driven through on my way to somewhere else, and the seemingly small people whose backs we live off of. There is so much heart here. I'm surprised this is a Disney movie."
"McFarland, USA","Anyway, I believe love drives us. And this is such an affirmation of the different types of love and relationships that can push us in the best ways and help us achieve greatness. I'm so deeply pleased to have seen this film. Every one of us has a moment or period when we are down for the count. We don't always handle it with grace. That doesn't mean we are without grace."
"McFarland, USA","In making this movie Kevin Costner stuck to the formula, the one that most feel good sports movies use, and made it work beautifully. There are no unexpected fancy twists in this one. The acting is straight up and solid. The ethnic background of the movie adds to the movie in good way. I enjoy a few of the scenes that involve the interactions between the coach or his family and the locals. They demonstrate how cultural interaction and familiarity can eliminate fear and breakdown the walls that divide us. Don't get me wrong, the movie is not trying to give you a social/cultural lecture, this stuff comes naturally mixed with the main story line."
"McFarland, USA","If you like the genre, you'll enjoy this movie."
"McFarland, USA","You would not think it at first glance but McFarland, USA turns out to be the site of an inspiring motion picture as well as the title for same. It's the story of a down and out high school coach played by Kevin Costner who in a last chance job takes one at a high school in the small town of McFarland, California having one of the poorest per capita incomes in the USA and made up of a mostly Chicano population who work mostly as fruit pickers. One of the first sites he sees at his new job as a Physical Education Teacher is mom picking up her three sons for their jobs as pickers after school."
"McFarland, USA","But those three brothers turn out to be an integral part of the cross country running team that he creates for the school. These kids see no future other than the fields of citrus fruit to pick and really have no confidence in themselves. Once he learns the culture Costner is able to motivate those kids to achieve not only in track, but in life."
"McFarland, USA","Costner and wife Maria Bello mix so well with them that they even have a Quincinera for their 15 year old daughter Morgan Saylor, a custom in Hispanic families kind of a coming out for a 15 year old daughter. The Quincinera also leads to a crisis of sorts, but it reaffirms the faith and trust that the kids and parents have developed in Costner."
"McFarland, USA","McFarland,USA is a fine family film from the Disney Studios and recommended most definitely for juvenile audiences."
"McFarland, USA","Set in the late 1980s, the film directed by Niko Caro, focus on the life trials of a downward spiraling career of high school football coach Jim White (Kevin Costner), whom has been fired from so many jobs, that he eventually ends up, in the only town that would hire him, McFarland, California. As his wife, Cheryl (Maria Bello) and two kids, Julie (Morgan Saylor) & Jamie (Elsie Fischer) struggles to fit into the majority low-income Hispanic neighborhood; White himself, struggles to reach the students and faculty of his new school. He eventually turns, his attention from football to cross country, because he sees some potential in some of the students; despite having no experience in the sport. Ultimately, White is able to create a team of ragtag of runners, with high school, students: Thomas Valles (Carlos Pratts), Johnny Sameniego (Hector Duran), Jose Cardenas (Johnny Ortiz), Victor Puentes (Sergio Avelar), Damacio Diaz (Michael Aguero), David Diaz (Rafael Martinez) and last Danny Diaz (Ramiro Rodriguez) as they try their hardest in becoming the state champion. Centering on the concept of teamwork and cooperation. McFarland, USA is able to teach viewers on the values of solidarity, very well; not only when it comes to sports, but also when it comes to working together as a community. It also teach people, not to judge others by racial stereotypes. You see, this, with Coach White. While, he might be a little prejudiced at his Hispanic students at first; you really do see some character development from White toward the middle, despite Kevin Costner barely acting. You see him, warm up to them, and later helps the runners, run their best, realizing this is what makes them special. Yet, this movie has also invoked some groans among some critics who recognize its 'white savior' premise as tiresome and clichés. I have to somewhat agree with them, on that. The white savior rescuing people of color from their poor plight, trope has indeed been overdone to death. Still, this movie was still entertaining, even if the film's messianic portrayal of Coach Jim White leading a ragtag group of Latino cross country team from McFarland, California to the state championship is a bit predictable and safe. I just wish, the movie took more chances with the subject matter. The plot didn't seem to stand out, that much, besides the few drama with Jim White's family, but at least, they kinda made cross-country seem somewhat intense. Since the movie isn't a documentary, Hollywood did change a little bit of how the team got to championship. A good example is how Jim White even got to coach at McFarland High School. No, he wasn't fired from a number of teaching jobs prior to teaching at McFarland. Instead, he started teaching in the McFarland school district after graduating from Pepperdine University in 1964. During that time, white taught different subjects at numerous grade levels before starting his coaching career in 1980, not 1987 with cross-country. Another thing, about that, is the fact that White did not create the cross-country team at the school, but instead restarted it after it had been dropped for a year. He also taught the school's girl's cross-country team, despite only the boys' team being featured in the film. Regardless of that, all of the supporting actors playing the team members were very good in their limited role. It just some of them, really don't stand out. I really got confused on, who is who, at parts. I also believe, the movie didn't need to over-exaggerate some of them to do that. A good example is how they portrayed Danny Diaz (Ramiro Rodriguez). He wasn't overweight in real life, nor was the slower member on the team. He was in fact, one of the fastest people at McFarland High School. They portray him, a little too cartoony. Another thing, the film fails to notice, is how not all of the runners from the 1987 team were featured in the film. It would be nice to see, original runner, Luis Partida in the team, because he indeed help them, win. Despite that, David Diaz (Rafael Martinez) was a great replacement. Even if, he graduated the year before McFarland's first state title win in real life. The supporting actors that played Jim White's family was also amazing. It's nice to see that the character that Maria Bello plays is given more to do, than being a supporting wife to Costner's character. She gets her own sub-plot, with her, trying to get along with the women in her neighborhood. Even the child actors that play Jim's kids, were fine in their roles. I just wish, they were able to hired another actress to play Jim's other daughter, Tami. Her absence from this film, is a bit jarring. Yet, I can understand, why the filmmakers wanted to combined those two characters (Jamie & Tami) together. It does save time. Overall: This poignant, uplifting tale is very heart-warming and inspirational. While, it might not stand out, much compare to other Disney sport films. It's still worth checking out. I'm in it, for the long run."
"McFarland, USA","""These are good kids, smart kids. They just need a chance at a better future."" Jim White (Costner) is a football coach at a prestigious high school. After a halftime outburst he is fired and takes a job in McFarland high as an assistant football coach. When a disagreement strips him of that position as well he isn't sure what to do next. When he sees one of the students running he decides it's time for the school to have a cross country team. Fighting with the runners, parents and school he does his best to transform the students, the school and the community. In terms of movies there is really one sure bet. If you put Kevin Costner in a sports movie it's gonna be good. Even with those high expectations this did not disappoint. The movie is tremendously inspiring. While watching there is a way you want it to end, and you are right there training and running with them hoping for the outcome you desire. The only bad I can say about it is that I liked his other ones better, but only because I like football and baseball more than running. That in no way diminishes the greatness of this movie though. Overall, Costner proves again why he is THE choice for sports movie actors. I give this an A."
"McFarland, USA","We all know the drill by now: a teacher, usually white (the one exception seems to be Sidney Poitier in ""To Sir With Love""), is sent to teach in a tough, predominately minority high school, filled with troubled teens and burned-out faculty members. At first, the hapless newbie is met with bemusement and resistance from the recalcitrant students, but, eventually, said teacher ultimately earns the trust and respect of all, often leading the kids and their school onto victory and glory in some sort of high-stakes contest (sporting event or whiz-kid competition, preferably). The granddaddy of them all, 1955's ""The Blackboard Jungle,"" established the blueprint that all the others that have come after it have felt obliged to follow. Indeed, the narrative arc is so familiar to us by now that only the names, places and specific details offer anything in the way of novelty."
"McFarland, USA","Enter ""McFarland, USA,"" the umpteenth version of the above scenario, this one featuring Kevin Costner as Jim White, a real life PE teacher/football coach who, out of desperation, takes a position at a high school in an impoverished farm community near Bakersfield, California circa 1987. The population of the town is composed almost exclusively of first and second generation Hispanic immigrants, mostly pickers, leaving White, his wife (Maria Bello) and their two young daughters (""Homeland's"" Morgan Saylor and Elsie Fisher) feeling a bit like fish-out-of-water in their new home."
"McFarland, USA","When he discovers that several young men in his PE class are phenomenal runners, Mr. White decides to start a cross country team at the school, bucking a skeptical principal, school board and rival teams every step of the way - not to mention straightening out the various personal and familial problems of the boys on his team (as well as coping with his own inadequacies as a father to his teenage daughter). Yet, after some early setbacks competing against a series of snooty white schoolsah well, you get the picture. And, of course, there's the inevitable offer of a position at a ""better"" school, leaving White with the dilemma of either leaving his charges in the lurch or staying on for the long haul."
"McFarland, USA","The thing is, though, that, while it would be easy to dismiss ""McFarland USA"" for its lack of freshness and originality, formulas are formulas for a reason, I suppose, and that is because they work. So, while you can resist it all you want, in the end you'll probably find yourself cheering on the boys as they cross the finish line, just as you'll be championing Mr. White for his ability to lead and inspire his charges both on the field and off. In short, though your brain may be looking for ways to reject ""McFarland USA,"" your heart will be telling you to let it in. It's pretty easy to predict which will emerge victorious in that battle."
"McFarland, USA","Nobody does the inspirational phoenix-rising-from-the-ashes bit better than Costner, and he is backed by a first-rate cast of young performers (Carlos Pratts, Johnny Ortiz, Rafael Martinez, Hector Duran, Sergio Avelar, Michael Aguero) who exude both naturalism and charm in their roles as disadvantaged youth who find meaning and pride in personal accomplishment and camaraderie. The movie also does a nice job showing how the bridges between various cultures are best built on the willingness to suspend preconceived judgments and to be open to new experiences."
"McFarland, USA","I had read the story of Jim White and the McFarland cross country team long before the movie came out. I was glad to see it made into a feature film, but Disney's heavy hands keep it from being fully satisfying."
"McFarland, USA","Most of the actors playing larger roles acquit themselves well. Yes, Kevin Costner is his overly familiar world-weary self, but there's always a certain charm in seeing him inhabit that role. Many of the young men portraying McFarland's runners are both charming and believable, and some of the quirky townspeople (such as the mother of three runners and the owner of the local variety store) add nice depth to the story."
"McFarland, USA","In addition, the scenery is interesting, from the running trails to the fields where the McFarland runners pick crops."
"McFarland, USA","One real turnoff was when, repeatedly, opposing runners were shown talking smack before the start of races, and opposing coaches made snarky comments about the McFarland team. I've coached youth sports for many years and am accustomed to seeing much better sportsmanship than that. The movie makers apparently needed to set up cartoonish villains so that the audience would root even harder for the good guys."
"McFarland, USA","Another clunker came at the first race, the ""Palo Alto Invitational."" The race director was surprised when McFarland showed up - but if it was an ""invitational,"" then either they'd been invited (so he shouldn't have been surprised) or they hadn't been (in which case they had no business going to the race)."
"McFarland, USA","This was a generally pleasant two hours, and it was good to know that the basic heartwarming events took place in real life. Could have been better (or at least less bad in some parts), but it was OK. I recommend you find the story ""Running for Their Lives"" by Gary Smith, the captivating real-life tale of Jim White and McFarland (told as only the brilliant Smith could)."
"McFarland, USA","'MCFARLAND, USA': Three Stars (Out of Five)"
"McFarland, USA","Disney's sports drama flick, based on a true story, about the high school coach of a Mexican-American cross country team, in a small California town in 1987. It stars Kevin Costner as the coach and was directed by Niki Caro (the director of such other critically acclaimed films as 2002's 'WHALE RIDER' and 2005's 'NORTH COUNTRY'). It was written by Christopher Cleveland, Bettina Gilois and Grant Thompson. I found the movie to be pretty routine, and clichéd, but not without it's moments."
"McFarland, USA","Costner plays Jim White; a high school football coach who's forced to relocate his family to McFarland, California; after getting into trouble in Boise, Idaho (for being too rough on his players). It's a mostly Hispanic small town and Jim worries that, due to gang violence there, it might not be the safest place to raise his two daughters (Morgan Saylor and Elsie Fisher). He attempts to fit in, at the school, but once again gets into trouble; this time with the head football coach. After noticing what fast runners a lot of the students are, he asks the principal if he can start a cross country team. White then begins enlisting troubled, but very quick, students."
"McFarland, USA","The story is an inspiring underdog tale, with a lot of heart, in classic sports film tradition. Costner is great in the leading role and the supporting cast, of mostly young unknown Hispanic actors, are all good too. The directing is decent, for this type of film, as well; but I think Caro's previous work is much better. While this movie goes through all the right motions, and does what it's basically supposed to, that's also (basically) all it does; there's nothing refreshing or original to it. I also found it quite boring, at times, due to it's clichéd nature and tired overused melodrama. It's an inspiring story though and Costner is especially good in it."
"McFarland, USA",Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/IG_hW4WZgWE
"McFarland, USA","Letterboxd/Time Out film critic David Ehrlich has two very keen observations on Niki Caro's new film ""McFarland, USA."" For one, he states that it's another film in the quietly condescending line of films where a white man learns that people of other races are ""capable of being decent,"" in an oddly funny but surprisingly true manner, especially with Costner's ""Black or White"" still in multiplexes nationwide. And secondly, there's the fact that ""McFarland, USA,"" despite being a Disney film about a sport (in this case, cross country), there is not a single training montage whatsoever in the film."
"McFarland, USA","Ehrlich, however, overlooked one detail and that's ""McFarland, USA"" is the best Disney sports film since ""Remember the Titans."" After last year's crushingly ordinary ""Million Dollar Arm,"" Disney rebounds with a film that not only understands its genre and the mental factor that comes into play for a cross country runner, but it understands minority culture very well, in this case, the life of Hispanic adolescents, who have been working in the fields since they were eleven and twelve years old. The film understands their roots, their struggles, and what it means for them to belong to something bigger than themselves, and it portrays such in a manner that isn't empty and emotionally-manipulative but rich with insight and humanity."
"McFarland, USA","The film opens with Jim White (Kevin Costner), a hot-headed football coach for a high school team that is getting destroyed at half time. After an outburst leads to a physical altercation with a player, White is dismissed with another blemish on an already tattered record. The only work he can find is in the working poor town of McFarland, California, where he relocates his family. ""Are we in Mexico?,"" his teenage daughter asks as they are driving through the streets of McFarland, observing the high volume of Hispanics."
"McFarland, USA","Upon relocation, White becomes the Earth science and physical education teacher for McFarland High School. After taking note that a gaggle of the kids in his P.E. class can run at unearthly speeds for multiple laps, he suggests to the already overwhelmed principal of the underfunded school if a cross country team could be implemented. Push comes to shove, compromises are made, and White becomes the one to create a cross country team and seek out seven runners to populate the team. The issue in gathering the faster runners is that many of them are self-proclaimed ""pickers,"" or teenagers that spend their mornings out picking crops in the field with the parents, doing exhausting manual labor that, in turn, puts food on their tables. White has to combat this element all while trying to give these kids something to be excited about."
"McFarland, USA","The runners steal the show every chance they get, one of whom is Thomas Valles (Carlos Pratts), the team's fastest runner. Valles is a troublemaker, offputting, but greatly troubled by an absent, workaholic father and a family falling apart at the seams. Three other runners are the Diaz brothers, the athletic Damacio (Michael Aguero) and David (Rafael Martinez), and the heavyset Danny (Ramiro Rodriguez), who still bears enough motivation and heart to succeed."
"McFarland, USA","I realize I may be summarizing ""McFarland, USA"" in what seems to be a posterbook of clichés, but the film's slick handling of tough subjects is anything but shortchanging. Quite frequently does the film shift its focus from Costner's White to the lives of the kids at hand, showing long hours in the picking fields along with stressful homelives that would break most privileged suburban children. These kids are warriors on the track and under their own roof, and the film does nothing but sympathize with their case rather than helplessly pitying them. Writers Christopher Cleveland, Bettina Gilois, and Grant Thompson also make it so it doesn't seem as if White is the ""white knight"" for these boys, as the boys recognize such strong, moral values themselves throughout the film and White is simply a vehicle to discovering those, as well."
"McFarland, USA","Costner's last film, ""Black or White,"" focusing on an ugly legal debate over the custody of Costner's interracial granddaughter, released not even a month ago in the United States, was a lukewarm drama with race as a key factor, but condescending in its portrayal of many of its black characters. ""McFarland, USA"" is the complete opposite, filling the adolescent characters with heart, humanity, and a strong sense of character rather than making them sink with their lesser traits."
"McFarland, USA","This is a crowd-pleaser of a film if I've ever seen one, and not the kind where the crowd is so pleased they forget to overlook huge issues like emotional manipulation, oversimplification, and blatant sociological flaws in depicting a culture or a group. ""McFarland, USA"" is an uncommonly strong film, not so much in its plot and its characters, all of which variations of things seen in the past or just familiar by convention, but there is such a strong depiction of culture and character in the film that that particular element is easy to ignore, given all the greatness on screen so pervasively."
"McFarland, USA","Rounding off my look back at Kevin Costner's career, I come to McFarland USA from 2015"
"McFarland, USA","Plot In A Paragraph: Jim White (Costner) a struggling coach and teacher takes a job in one of the poorest cities in America: McFarland, California. There he discovers buried potential in several high school boys, and slowly turns them into a track team and brings them closer than even he could ever imagine."
"McFarland, USA","Hands down my favourite movie of 2015. No matter how many times I watch it, I still get chills at the end."
"McFarland, USA","It's funny how many reviews read something like this ""predictable, routine, generic"" etc however whilst it's true that Disney's sports movie formula is pretty well-worn. You can apply this plot to a lot of movies ""Fish out of water comes and turns a team of losers into champions while learning valuable life lessons along the way."" Yes It happens every time. However McFarland USA is a true story. Kevin Costner is playing a real man in Jim White, and no they didn't change his name to make it for better."
"McFarland, USA",I can't speak highly enough about this movie. It's in my Top 10 Kevin Costner movies.
"McFarland, USA","""That's not Danny Diaz....... THATS NOT DANNY DIAZ!!!"""
"McFarland, USA","The thought of a movie about running can be off putting, but personally I feel that you should give this movie a chance."
"McFarland, USA","You won't be surprised that much by what happens as the structure of it is similar to hundreds of other flicks: the typical success story of a bunch of kids you would not bet $5 on. In this case, they have the gift of running, and their trainer (Kevin Costner) is the man to lead them. By the way, after so many years, I still don't know what to think about Kevin Costner. Is he a good actor? or is he just lucky to still get some roles? I haven't got a clue, but either way, his acting will not spoil the movie."
"McFarland, USA","Since it's based on real events, you'll probably watch it out curiosity and forgive any lack of cinematographic quality. You should find it up-lifting and a good enough watch."
"McFarland, USA","MacFarland is a gentle, pleasant sports drama that stars Kevin Costner as football coach, Jim White who after losing his job washes up in some small, dirt poor, dead end town full of Mexicans in a high school in McFarland."
"McFarland, USA",White and his family feel uncomfortable but discovers that his Hispanic pupils are talented runners but once the school day is over and even before school starts they are working in the local farms picking crops in order to earn enough money for their families.
"McFarland, USA",White inspires them and transforms them into cross country runners but they have to deal with antagonistic rival high school coaches and rich white kids with snide comments.
"McFarland, USA",Costner is now an old hand with sports themed movies. This has enough quirky charm as well as humour as an outsider who unearths genuine talent in this fact based story and at the same time becomes a valued member of the community.
"McFarland, USA","The synopsis of this movie will probably make you think it's a cheesy Disney movie about a washed up teacher who makes a difference to his bad-boy students. It's not that movie. It's a fantastic, moving, inspiring tale that you'll want to buy and add to your collection."
"McFarland, USA","Kevin Costner plays a fired high school football coach with nowhere else to go but McFarland, USA, the poorest town in America in 1987. The kids there have no hope and no motivation, because before and after school they're out in tomato or lettuce fields helping their parents pick produce. They're not going to college; they'll become pickers when they graduate."
"McFarland, USA","Costner sees his kids running after school and comes up with the idea of creating a cross country team. With no funding, no support, and no clue what he's doing, he starts training the kids."
"McFarland, USA","The cross country portions of the film are exciting and fun to watch, but there's a lot more to this movie than the plot I just outlined. Costner and his family learn to make their new house their home, and this half of the film is interesting, tension-filled, and heartwarming. It's terribly sad to see the state of the town and how the poor residents survive, when the rest of America is thriving. Costner's character is unaware of their struggle when he first arrives, as most of the viewers will be, but as he gets to know his neighbors and bonds with the community, he (and we) are exposed to their cultural traditions."
"McFarland, USA","If you're not drawn to the movie because of the sports, or the inspirational story, or because you like true stories, or you like Kevin Costner, I'll give you one more reason to watch it: Maria Bello's costumes. I've never seen her look so pretty, and she wears the most darling outfits!"
"McFarland, USA","But seriously, watch McFarland, USA. It's incredibly moving to watch how one teacher impacted a community and inspired a group of boys to look higher up than an agricultural field."
"McFarland, USA","Hollywood has been good in one area a couple decades into the 21st century. It has turned out some very good sports films based on true stories. ""McFarland, USA"" is one. The movie was made by Disney in 2015, from a screenplay that was being developed since 2004. It's based on a true story of a high school teacher, Jim White, who made championship cross-country teams in the mid-1980s at a small California high school. The town of McFarland is in the farm area of central California, north of Bakersfield. The high school is largely Hispanic."
"McFarland, USA","Kevin Costner heads the cast as White, and all turn in fine performances. This is a very good drama, historical and biographical film. It is peppered with small doses of humor. The production qualities are superb. As with most such films, this one has been changed from fact to fiction in places. But, it tells a good story about a coach, a town and a high school team."
"McFarland, USA","Some of the fictional changes including White having been fired from different teaching jobs before going to McFarland. In reality, he began there in 1964 after he graduated from Pepperdine University. White taught different classes and grades until 1980 when he began coaching. When he noticed the speed of some of the kids, he decided to start cross-country running which the school had dropped the previous year. The film is just about the boys' team, but he started both boys and girls teams, and took both of them to the Cayucos beach during the 1985 season."
"McFarland, USA","White had three daughters, not two as in the movie. And they were older in real life. At the time of the cross-country championships, the girls were in college."
"McFarland, USA",The move was a hit and apparently led to increased interest in cross- country running in schools around the country. This is a good film that should be of special interest to young teens.
"McFarland, USA","Here are a couple of favorite lines from the film. Cheryl White, ""Fourth place? That's not too shabby. Jim, ""Four out of four – also known as last."""
"McFarland, USA","Jim White, ""Tell your father I said it was an honor to be invited into his home."" David Diaz, ""Dad, he said it was an honor to be invited into your home."" Senor Diaz, ""Tell him I said 'Thanks!'"""
"McFarland, USA",A very heart rendering film where a school coach comes to a disadvantaged Mexican school in Los Angeles and starts a running team there.
"McFarland, USA","While the film is clichéd, there are good rendering moments when eventually he forsakes an opportunity to go to a much better position to work with these fellows."
"McFarland, USA",Kevin Costner is perfectly cast as the coach. He actually goes out and not only lives among these people; he works in the fields as well. Nothing better than to get to know someone by living in their shoes.
"McFarland, USA","Maria Bello is rather subdued as his wife. Perhaps, it's because she is the mother of his two daughters."
"McFarland, USA","McFarland, USA is a city in California that to this day has a sizable Hispanic population, many of whom work as migrant farm workers picking crops. ""McFarland"" is a film that tells the story of Coach White, a passionate coach who gets fired from his football coaching gig at a wealthy high school when he escalates a fight between him and his players to violence. The wealthy high school football players seemed more concerned about the after party than the game. Athletics for these players is a prestige thing that has nothing to do with sportsmanship. After a series of disrespectful actions, Coach White snaps and subsequently gets fired. But as Coach White reflects later to another coach when he arrives at his new school, ""It's not the fight in the dog coach, it's the dog in the fight...depends on the size of the dog...""."
"McFarland, USA","Coach White moves to Cliff Avenue in a Hispanic neighborhood with his wife and two daughters. When he first arrives in the new neighborhood, one of his daughters questions if the family had ended up in Mexico. The Whites struggle at first to fit into their new neighborhood. Meanwhile, the high school students in the small Hispanic town of McFarland have their own struggle. Most of the students at MacFarland have jobs. Athletics isn't even an option for many of them because they come from the fields to go to school and run back to the fields when class gets outs. Many become adults in those very fields. Unless a prison gets to them first. It is a hard life which stands in stark contrast to the lives of Coach White's previous students. He begins to see the athletic potential in his hardworking students and questions the temporary nature of his transitory job as coach at MacFarland."
"McFarland, USA","In the classic Disney fashion, Coach White's new community welcomes him. His neighbor even plants him a tree and tells him, ""in five years senor you're going to have some nice shade"". The simple transitions in the film show the migrant worker's lives with Hispanic music in the background. The scenes are poetic. But the most beautiful part of the film is the raw determination of the high school students trying to compete in a sport and environment that sets them up for failure. A boy named Thomas Valles becomes a de facto leader of the team after Coach White catches the high school student running at 12 miles an hour. This same boy shows up to practice with bruises because he gets his dad to punch him instead of a wall since as a migrant worker his father needs his hands to work. It isn't until coach White works a whole day as a migrant worker himself, picking crops getting paid by the field instead of by the hour that he begins to understand the plight of his athletes."
"McFarland, USA","In the spirit of Stand and Deliver Coach White understands that he needs to go beyond his position as coach for these students. He begins to treat them like his own. During one scene, he rushes to a park without enough money for the entrance fee and tells the officer, ""I've got five dollars and seven kids who have never seen the ocean"". He brings his students to the beach."
"McFarland, USA","Eventually, McFarland becomes more than a temporary home for Coach White and his family. It becomes their community, one which adopts them as warmly as they adopted it. The family moments such as the father's speech at his daughters quinceañera will tug at your heartstrings. Coach White disproves Thomas Valles' initial belief that, ""Nobody stays in McFarland unless they have to. Because there is nothing American dream about this place"". This film is based off a true story and Coach White ended up at McFarland coaching at the town's high school long after better prospects opened up for him. By the end, Coach White recognizes that these kids at McFarland cherish cross country and athletics, something he admits is a privilege many take for granted."
"McFarland, USA","Ah the Disney sports movie. I'm sure we've all got our favourite (mines a tie between Remember the Titans and the Mighty Ducks if you're wondering) and I'm sure we all know what to expect from the Mouse House's sports tinged productions, from trials over adversity's, music scored training monologues and fine use of poetic license to tell true stories in a Hollywood themed way. The genre is a well tried and well liked staple of movie fans and McFarland, USA is a finely tuned example of a cookie cutter sports movie that never becomes anything more than we'd expect, and that's absolutely fine."
"McFarland, USA","The presence of New Zealand born director Niki Caro is certainly a help to McFarland's non-lofty ambitions, a director who has seen great success in dramas like Whale Rider and North Country and she brings a neat feel to the film here that helps cover up some of the films more pure Disney cheese moments like Kevin Costner's Jim White's daughters birthday bash or some stench ridden dialogue that just does not in the slightest ring true. Without Caro on board behind the scenes this tale of cross country runners from the harsh working class town of McFarland could've really been lost in an abundance of Disney fluff but with her fine work and that of Kevin Costner's, the film coasts by as a likable and fun tale."
"McFarland, USA","Once the biggest movie star in the world, the last few years have seen Kevin Costner try his best to once more become relevant and while The Company Men and to a lesser extent Man of Steel are good examples of decent filmmaking, McFarland is quite possibly his most assured film role in some time and reminds us all that he has a unique presence on camera that is put to good use in his Coach White's dealing with his rag tag group of cross country runners who mostly hail from poor Mexican families who rely on fruit picking for a living. Whenever Coach White and the boys take centre stage or even the town of McFarland itself, the film really becomes a blast."
"McFarland, USA","Filmed with a nice energy, McFarland, USA is a likable and enjoyable sports movie romp that delivers a telling of a true life tale that will bring a smile to even the unhappiest of faces. After many years of Disney sports movies and sports movies in general, you should go into this film under no illusions as to what you're going to get and the results will be exactly what the movie doctor has ordered."
"McFarland, USA",3 ½ enthusiastic flag waving spectators out of 5
"McFarland, USA","It's 1987. Jim White (Kevin Costner) is struggling to coach high school football in Boise, Idaho. He throws a shoe near a disrespectful player and it ricochets bloodying him. He and his wife Cheryl (Maria Bello) move to McFarland, California with their two daughters. It's a lower class Latino area and the only teaching job he could get. He gets kicked out as assistant football coach in the first week. He notices that some of the kids have potential as runners."
"McFarland, USA",Kevin Costner can do the hard angry white guy in his sleep now. There are some pretty interesting young actors among the Latino kids. It's an inspirational based-on-a-true-story. It follows the traditional underdog formula. They have to face the obvious racism and all the expected hurdles. There isn't much drama. There are a few funny moments. There are opportunities to dig a lot deeper. The incident with Julie could be expanded on. Instead the movie does a little before and after. The heart of the incident and the reason for it are never fully explained. There is also the problem of filming running as a sport. The film does it the best that they can but the calculating process makes it less dramatic. This is a perfectly fine sports movie.
True Story,"""True Story"" from 2015 stars Jonah Hill and James Franco as writer Mike Finkel and killer Christian Longo, respectively."
True Story,"Finkel was a well-regarded journalist for the New York Times who fudged a story and combined five people into one, was caught, and was fired."
True Story,"He learns later that a man who murdered his wife and three children, Christian Longo, was caught in Mexico and was at the time using the name Mike Finkel. Intrigued, Finkel arranges a meeting."
True Story,"What follows is a bonding experience, where Longo claims to be a long-time fan of Finkel, and Finkel finds similarities between his own life and is impressed that he and Finkel even take similar types of notes. Longo asks that none of the information he gives Finkel be released until after the trial and promises him exclusivity. In exchange, Longo would like to learn to write the way that Finkel can and asks for pointers."
True Story,Finkel begins to believe that Longo is covering someone and doubts his guilt. He also realizes that the story is more than article -
True Story,it's a book.
True Story,It's not until the trial that Finkel learns the true story.
True Story,"Good film about an actual case, but while it's effective, it doesn't have the bone-chilling quality it could have. The acting is good, particularly by Franco who has the showier role. The acting is done in a naturalistic style - a tiny bit more punch in a film like this might have helped as it lacks some necessary emotion."
True Story,"I think a stronger script or even more potent direction could have made this a truly devastating experience. As it is, it's interesting without being fascinating."
True Story,"if you'd asked me to rate this half way through, i'd say it was at least 8 or 9, everything was well done, a well made film that had you guessing and the cast was great..."
True Story,"but then you realise there was no clever ending, no twist, no moment where all the pieces come together... unfortunately, at the title suggests, this is a true story, and the reality is there is no real story to tell."
True Story,"really disappointing, missed opportunity in my opinion as the cast was perfect, the tension was built up, the filming was so well done... for nothing."
True Story,"True stories... are often boring, people argue that 'that's what really happened'... that's fine but many things happen, every day, they just don't need multi million pound films made about them."
True Story,"""True Story"" (2015 release; 100 min.) brings the story of how a reporter becomes entangled in a murder suspect's world. As the movie opens, we see some brutal images of a young child being stuffed into a suitcase, which later turns up in the water. What is going on here? After the opening credits, we get to know Michael Finkel (played by Jonah Hill), a New York Times reporter, as he interviews young men somewhere in Africa. Alas, later on he is caught fabricating some of the facts for the subsequent NYT piece and he is let go in disgrace. Meanwhile, we get to know Christian Longo (played by James Franco), accused of killed his wife and 3 young kids. When he is rounded up, he claims to be Michael Finkel, NYT reporter. It is not long before Longo makes contact, from jail, with the real Mike Finkel. To tell you more would spoil your viewing pleasure, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out."
True Story,"Couple of comments: ""True Story"" is based on the Mike Finkel book of the same name, and if of course a true story. The premise of the movie is really intriguing (and cleverly played up in the trailer), reason I went to see this in the first place, namely is Longo somehow playing Finkel, while being in jail, and if so, what disastrous effects could that have for Finkel? Alas, in the movie it doesn't bear out. There is lots of build up in the movie, and ultimately not enough pay-off. I am all for a long build-up, but there has to be a reward for sticking with the build up, and when the reward finally comes, it's simply not enough. A quick word about the acting performances: James Franco does what he can with the limited material that is given to him. Jonah Hill is okay as the disgraced NYT reporter. The real star of the movie Felicity Jones in the role of Jill, the girlfriend of Mike Finkel. I also want to give props to prolific soundtrack composer Marco Beltrami (recently of The November Man; The Drop; The Giver, just to name those), who once again provides a lovely soundtrack."
True Story,"The early evening theater screening where I saw this at was attended not very well (less than 10 people), but in fairness, it was a weekday evening. That said, while this is not a 'bad' movie per se, nor do I feel that the movie is all that it could've become. That said, if you have a chance to check out ""True Story"", be it in the theater or on DVD/Blu-ray, I suggest you do and draw your own conclusion."
True Story,"Back in 2001 Christian Longo's wife and three children were found dead in various locations, apparently murdered. Longo himself disappeared and was put on the ""most wanted"" list. He was found not long after in Mexico, he was claiming to be New York Times journalist Michael Finkel. In 2003 he was tried and found guilty, and sentenced to death. Now, 13 years later he apparently is still on death row."
True Story,"This movie only treats the murders themselves in a very brief manner, does not dwell on them at all. Instead it focuses on the relationship Longo and Finkel developed. Finkel was a very recent journalistic outcast for having falsified a story about boys held into slavery and was desperately searching for redemption and also a nice paycheck. When Longo requested him, he was more than happy to meet him."
True Story,The best thing about this movie are the acting of Jonah Hill as Michael Finkel and James Franco as Christian Longo. Both actors have been in some very poor and stupid comedic roles but here they are straight dramatic roles and each handles it very nicely.
True Story,"The story is interesting but the focus in on how Longo manipulated Finkel and how Finkel lapped it up. The movie is based on Finkel's own book and, coming off his disgrace for lying, I would presume it is mostly accurate."
True Story,Watched the DVD from my local public library. There are a couple of interesting extras and we see and hear Finkel himself.
True Story,"This film has been maligned by some for being too slow moving and having an unsatisfying ending. This is a common rant by some. This is a very well presented portrayal of a relationship between two men who are more alike than different. Michael Finkel is a disgraced reporter. He gets fired from the New York Times for shortcutting a story. His reputation is pretty much shot until he gets a call from a man, Christian Longo, who has been accused of murdering his wife had his three children. A bond develops between them and Finkel, but is this man a truth teller or pathological liar and murderer. This is what Finkel must sort out. In the process, an obsession occurs, where he investigates to the exclusion of everything else. The acting is superb and the story easily holds one's interest to the bitter end. I believe that getting there is twice the fun and if the conclusion didn't satisfy people, I feel they missed out on something pretty unique."
True Story,"True Story is based on the novel by Mike Finkel recounting his relationship with Christian Longo(James Franco), a man accused of murdering his wife and three children. Finkel(Jonah Hill)is a young up and coming journalist writing for the New York Times when his career is derailed after he plays a little fast and loose with some facts of a recently published article. While trying to plan the next chapter in his professional life he receives a call from a reporter looking to get an angle on the story about Longo. It seems that he was using Finkel's identity when he was captured in Mexico. Finkel is naturally curious but also smells a story that could put his career back on track."
True Story,Finkel and Longo arrange to meet and what follows are a series of meetings where both men engage in a dialogue meant to extract as much information as possible from the other. But how much of what Longo shares is the truth? How does Finkel use the information he gets?
True Story,"The main problem with this movie is the pay-off, or the lack thereof. The story is simply not as interesting as it sounds. Honestly, it's no ones fault. The direction by first timer Rupert Goold is solid, well paced, and true to the story. The acting is good even if it is a little weird to see Hill and Franco together in serious roles. The best way to describe it might be we all know someone(friend or family member) who is excited to tell a story of something that happened to them or something they witnessed and when they are done, looking to you for a reaction, all you can say is ""Is that it?"""
True Story,The most compelling aspect of the film is Finkel coming to grips with the fact that he has to determining what is the truth and what is a lie. Not unlike his readers had to do after reading his last story for the Times. One liar interrogating another.
True Story,"In the end, the build up leads to very little. The ride was interesting but the destination was a big disappointment."
True Story,"Greetings again from the darkness. ""Sometimes the truth isn't believable. But that doesn't mean it's not true"". These words are spoken by Christian Longo, the man accused of brutally murdering his wife and 3 kids in 2001. The line between truth and lies is at the core of this real life story based on journalist Michael Finkel's memoir and recollections of his conversations with Longo."
True Story,"The New York Times investigative reporter Michael Finkel (Jonah Hill) is introduced to us as he is researching the story which ultimately leads to his dismissal, after it's discovered he played fast and loose with details in order to present a more impactful story. Soon he receives an odd phone call from an Oregon writer (Ethan Suplee) who informs Finkel that his name is being used by Longo (James Franco), the suspected murderer who was recently captured in Mexico. As a disgraced journalist, Finkel seizes the opportunity to connect with Longo, and soon enough the two morally-compromised men are locked in psychological warfare, where we as viewers aren't sure just who is using who in this oddball ""friendship""."
True Story,"Hill and Franco are best known for their raunchy and raucous comedies, and both deliver much ""quieter"" performances than what we have come to expect from them. While it's a bit of stretch to buy Jonah Hill as a renowned writer, Franco is absolutely chilling as a manipulative psychopath. Franco is so good in the role that he overpowers Hill, which undermines what was supposed to be an intricate game of cat and mouse."
True Story,"Franco is a frightening figure on the courtroom witness stand as he tells his version of that fateful night, and he is equally unnerving to watch in general conversation with Finkel. However, the single best scene in the film comes when Felicity Jones unleashes the wrath of truth on Franco's Longo. Ms. Jones is otherwise underutilized for most of the film, as her relationship with Finkel is never really explored."
True Story,"Rather than provide any substantive background on what makes either Finkel or Longo tick, we are instead left to make our own assumptions based on the framed magazine covers and the spurts of flashbacks. And thus the film's biggest flaw is cheating us out of the backstory that might help explain the otherwise fascinating conversations/showdowns between these two flawed gents  one significantly more flawed than the other."
True Story,"It's impossible not to compare this to Truman Capote's ""In Cold Blood"" and the subsequent films based on his writing experience: Capote (2005), and Infamous (2006). Stretching and bending the truth are common themes, as are intriguing and disturbing insights from the writers and the accused."
True Story,"There are times True Story comes off as little more than a made for TV movie, but the best moments more than make up for it, and Franco's portrayal will stick with you long after Finkel finally understands who and what he is dealing with. It's also a reminder that there are people who ""want the truth so badly"" they ""will lie to get it"". Try saying that with a wink."
True Story,"New York Times reporter Michael Finkel (Jonah Hill) gets the front page but his story turns out to be a false amalgamation of different people. He gets fired in disgrace. Nobody is willing to hire him. Then he gets a call from a local Oregon reporter Pat Frato (Ethan Suplee). Christian Longo (James Franco) has been arrested for the murder of his wife and three children. Unbeknownst to him, Christian has been using his identity. Christian grants him exclusive access."
True Story,"At no time did I think that Christian is innocent. At best, the circumstance of the murders could be interesting but Franco plays him guilty from the very beginning. With no mystery, the question becomes where the tension of the movie would come from. The theme of truth is useful with Finkel's constant modification of his relationship with the concept. Even there, losing the book deal is not enough to inject the necessary tension. Although the movie floats the idea, Christian is never threatened with release. There is simply no danger of anything. At best, it's a character study but Finkel needs to have a darker treatment. This is an intriguing story that comes to not much."
True Story,"""True Story"" concerns Michael Finkel (Jonah Hill), a respected journalist for ""The New York Times"" who has made a name for himself with numerous front-page articles. When he takes his latest piece, concerning contemporary African slave trading, and deeply obscures specific details about his subjects, he is fired from his job and his reputation is tarnished. While residing in the middle of nowhere with his wife, Michael receives word that his likeness has been used by a man named Christian Longo (James Franco), who is convicted of killing his wife and their three children. Michael travels to prison to meet and talk with Christian, who he is stunned to find is a soft-spoken, frightened soul with a story to tell of his own. After learning of Christian's own personal perspective of the murders, Michael begins to write a book on him, finding himself caught between a wedge of believing Christian's story but also looking at indisputable facts of the case."
True Story,"Right off the bat, it's odd to see both Jonah Hill and James Franco in a film together and not creating a raunchy, ribald atmosphere. While both men have ventured into drama before (especially Franco, who is, dare I say, the most diverse actor in Hollywood), having these two men work together and not drum up any laughs is a strange thing to note. However, this fact becomes less apparent when we remember, and it only takes moments to do so once the film begins, how great Hill and Franco are at playing complex, layered dramatic roles. Hill's straight-forward seriousness combined with Franco's mannered eloquence creates a story that works from the start on the basis of actor chemistry and effectiveness alone."
True Story,"The film bears a strong resemblance to Truman Capote's book ""In Cold Blood,"" as we watch a journalist get so invested in the lives of a murderer who winds up developing tunnel vision so narrow that he can't see the obvious guilt and manipulation around him. Michael becomes wrapped up with finding out who Christian really is as a person, enthralled by his perspective, which has been muted by what seems to be sensational headlines and news reports, that he simply wants to get to the heart of his subject. Yet, when we see a family completely broken and another telling his side of the story, not really justifying his actions nor explicitly denying them, we become entangled in a web of conflicting testimonies."
True Story,"To respond to ""True Story"" in a manner of confusion is only natural; if anything, you're exhibiting conflicting attitudes the real life Michael Finkel probably did when he met Christian Longo and spoke with him over time. The film subtly answers the questions of truth and examines how perspective and stories, when told rather than pushed aside or muted, do not justify an entire situation, especially one so heinous, but work to complicate it and leave no questions easily answered. We become just as entangled as Michael, and when the film ends, ostensibly without progressing a whole lot, we find ourselves left to our own vices in terms of how we analyze what we just watched."
True Story,"""True Story"" is destined to be one of the most underrated and misunderstood pictures of the year, and the latter because of the fact that there are going to be a barrage of ways one can digest this film. Some have criticized the film for seemingly rooting for the redemption of Christian before doubling back in the concluding trial scenes, yet consider how Michael views him throughout the entire film. He clearly wants the man to redeemed if he had done anything wrong, and tries to believe that he has a troubled, deeply confused soul in his company. However, facts catch up and it is then we realize what we're dealing with, and that's one of the reasons ""True Story"" is so special; it leads us one way, gets us believing one thing, before calling us on our bluff and letting our guard down."
True Story,"I guess they were leaving it up to the audience on whether or not James Franco's Chris killed his family or not, for those who knew nothing of the case or read the book becausethey failed to really focus on the grisly murdered family. I wondered that as I watched this interesting, but never elevated back-and-forth, accused and writer relationship. Johan Hill did fine as Mike, but just as he said in the movie: there's enough here for an entire book – not just an article, I felt that this movie was basically an article on the events and not the whole story. Mercifully, the strange, but severely underdeveloped relationship between the men, kept me intrigued. And while I can see where the focus was from the screenplay writer and director, it's sad that the brutal murders of three innocent children and their mother seem completely incidental and almost meaningless."
True Story,"Had his movie been more fleshed out and gave more to all angles vs. just a weird bond, I might have liked it more. Instead we get a 99 minute, couple of chapters of a grander and more interesting, albeit depressing story."
True Story,"Saw True Story (film) starring Jonah Hill, James Franco, and Felicity Jones at Regal Cinemas last night! The film is based on actual events. It was very unusual, yet interesting and visually stimulating to see both Jonah and James playing roles so out of their ordinary type. Hill portrays Michael Finkel, The New York Times journalist who is subsequently terminated by the paper after being accused of incomplete research and creating a composite character, a boy named Youssouf Male while covering a story in an article about Ivory Coast Cocoa Plantations."
True Story,"After being let go by the Times, Finkel (Hill) struggles to find journalistic job opportunities until one day he receives a mysterious phone call from a man regarding an FBI – Federal Bureau of Investigation Most Wanted individual named Christian Longo, portrayed by Franco, who is wanted for murdering his entire family and is eventually captured in México while claiming to be living as Finkel. Finkel decides this is an opportunity story of a life time, so he meets with Longo trying to figure out why his now tarnished journalistic name was used by this accused murderer."
True Story,"Finkel agrees to share his journalistic expertise with Longo in exchange for information regarding the murders for his Murder Memoir which tells a ""True Story"" regarding the events portrayed in the film. While in Newport, Oregon County Jail awaiting trial, Longo corresponds with Finkel via U.S. Mail, sending him written clues which appear to be confusing and misleading about his family life, yet enough information to put the pieces of the puzzle together and compile a Murder Memoir. Finkel attends the trial and at the end he uncovers the ""True Story."""
True Story,"The film has several twists and turns which will keep you interested. It was cool to see both Hill and Franco play roles no one would ever think they would take on. Both actors handled this ""True Story"" film brilliantly! Not a must see, but definitely worth seeing if you want to experience these veteran actor Academy Award Nominees in diverse roles. My cinema score is 7/10! ‪#‎maverickradio‬"
True Story,"It's hard for me to find this movie interesting. I didn't really get it. But yes, the opening seemed so promising. Not to mention the character of Christian Longo himself. He's some kind of crazy person or even a psycho, perhaps? He's so unpredictable. Looks stupid but turned out to be smart and so deceiving. This was actually so good, but I couldn't stop thinking that there was something missing. Why Longo chooses to use Finkle's identity was not so well explained. Maybe the dialogue which was not so strong. To me, the story was just not so well explored."
True Story,"This movie is based on a memoir of Michael Finkel. I usually love movies based on true story, but not this one.Sorry. I don't know. It's just not easy to grasp. I need to consult Wikipedia to fill the holes in my head."
True Story,"I had been looking forward to True Story since I first saw the trailer in December. And then I read reviews tonight on it and was pretty worried. I actually almost didn't go to the theater to see it. I almost considered waiting for the DVD (or Digital HD rather, Ha) release. I am glad I didn't."
True Story,"I am not going to recap the entire summary of the film, as if you are reading this, chances are you already know it, and if you don't, the less you know the better. I just finished researching the true story of the film, and it appears this film is quite close to the truth. (Unlike the characters in the film)"
True Story,"This is a movie about deception involving characters that fabricate the truth to incredible lengths and spin endless webs of lies. One character to a lesser extent to the other, but I found it interesting how this film portrayed the similarities between these two men. The story is brilliantly woven, and extreme attention to detail is paid. The cinematography is beautiful, the acting is solid, this is just all around an exceptionally well made film. It's tragic, yet very thought provoking."
True Story,"The main two complaints I heard in critical reviews were that the film lacked suspense, and that it was a whole lot of buildup with no payoff. The no payoff criticism concerned me the most, as I can't stand movies like that, and that criticism seemed to be the biggest people were making."
True Story,"Realize going in, this is a psychological drama/thriller. I personally was riveted and in constant psychological suspense, but there isn't any real physical suspense throughout the film. The suspense comes from a psychological place, falling victim to the constant mind games, and not knowing what the truth really is."
True Story,"And as for the biggest criticism, that there wasn't any payoff, I couldn't disagree more. I'd like to ask these critics to their face - how much more payoff are you looking for? Given the details of the true events, there isn't any more payoff that could have been provided, in fact, I felt the payoff of this film to be big. It was a psychologically riveting experience that provided a lot to think about long after the end credits rolled."
True Story,I did not see that coming. James Franco and Jonah Hill together in a movie that is not a comedy.
True Story,"Sure, out of the hilarious cast of This is the End, it would make the most since that these two would do drama, but still, I went into this movie expecting it to be a laughable mess, but was really amazed how well done it was."
True Story,"You got to get over the fact that it's Franco and Hill. Individually the two of them doing drama is a lot easier to swallow, especially Jonah with things like Money Ball and Wolf of Wall Street on his resume. You can take it serious when the two are apart, but together you're expecting comedy."
True Story,"What's interesting about True Story is that Hill and Franco are playing the archetypes that you'd expect from them, and because of this, the movie could have easily worked as a comedy. It was Hill and Franco doing what you seen them do a million times in comedies but doing it in a drama piece. It does not make the movie better (it may have done better if they made it a comedy), but it made the movie more interesting."
True Story,"Both men did a fine job with the material, it was well acted by everyone involved. I would recommend giving it a shot."
True Story,"Sadly, there is not much to say about True Story. It's a crime/mystery 'thriller' (labeling this a thriller is questionable) that plays out just as you would expect. There were far too few surprises to speak of, which the movie seemed to be moving toward. Everything here felt like 'the calm before the storm' but when it came time for the storm, there was nothing there. The story in itself is quite interesting, a murder taking on the identity of a writer which leads to the two interacting and trying to determine the motive behind such a weird act. But nothing ever comes of it, at least nothing interesting or thought provoking. True Story is a straightforward crime drama that finishes as a courtroom drama."
True Story,"The acting was decent enough, a strong cast, but the camera work tries to force the creepy persona of James Franco down our throats with a ton of close of shots of his face. It was difficult to see a monster, he may look scruffy but down under there was no beast to be found here. The character of Longo was never creepy enough to carry the movie (Hopkins had 13 minutes of screen time in Silence of the Lambs and created a truly frightening monster)."
True Story,"So while the trailer might look appealing, just now that it's quite deceptive (just like the main theme of the movie). Like I said, everything found here was too calm for its own good, there was no huge reveal or anything like that to make this movie interesting. Certainly a forgettable movie within Franco and Hill's growing filmographies."
True Story,"I saw ""True Story"", starring Jonah Hill-The Wolf of Wall Street, This is the End; James Franco-This is the End, Spider-Man 1,2 &3; Felicity Jones- The Theory of Everything, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and Ethan Suplee-The Wolf of Wall Street, My Name is Earl_tv."
True Story,"This is not a comedy-with Jonah & James, you might have thought that it would be-and it is based on a true story-I bet you did not see that coming, from the title-about a man accused of the disturbing crime of killing his wife and 3 children. Jonah plays a reporter for the New York Times that gets fired because he lied about some details of a story he turned in- sounds kind of like the Brian Williams story where he was caught enhancing a story. James plays the man that allegedly slaughtered his entire family- thankfully, the actual crimes are not shown but they are talked about. Jonah receives a phone call from Ethan, informing him about James and his sordid past. At first, Jonah does not understand the purpose of calling him until he hears that when James was caught, he was using Jonah's identity to hide. Of course Jonah wants to know why James picked him and so he contacts James in prison to try to get some answers. Felicity plays Jonah's girlfriend, who does not like or trust James. There is a lot of back and forth between Jonah & James with doubts and issues of trust popping up and what or who to believe. As the end credits start, you learn answers about who really did what and what their situation is now. It is a compelling story. It's rated ""R"" for language and disturbing material and has a running time of 1 hour & 39 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD-once was enough-but it would be a good rental."
True Story,'TRUE STORY': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)
True Story,"A dramatic crime-thriller, starring Jonah Hill and James Franco! It definitely takes a little while to get used to. The story revolves around a reporter investigating a man accused of murdering his wife and children, in Oregon, for a book he's writing. It's based on the memoir of Michael Finkel, the reporter that Hill plays in the film; while Franco plays the accused killer. The movie was directed by Rupert Goold and scripted by David Kajganich and Goold. It's a bit of a mess, but it's still worth watching and interesting enough (in some ways)."
True Story,"Michael Finkel (Hill) was a rising successful reporter, working for the New York Times, until his employers discovered he falsified information in one of his stories; he was terminated because of it. He later learned that a man, named Christian Longo (Franco), was using his name to hide out under, in Mexico, until he was arrested for murdering his wife and children. He was fascinated by this and decided to meet Longo, while he was being held in a prison, in Oregon. Upon meeting Finkel, Longo told the reporter that he'd tell him his side of the story, if he taught him how to write; and kept everything he told him a secret. Finkel agreed to the arrangement, because he saw it as a big opportunity to get his career back on track. He quickly learned that Longo, and his stories, were not as they first appeared."
True Story,"At first I definitely didn't buy Hill, in the dramatic leading man role; but I couldn't decide if it was me not giving him enough of a chance, or Hill not being the right actor for the part. I also didn't think much of Franco's acting, in this movie, at first either. Then seeing the two of them, on screen together, made the movie seem even less realistic. After some time, a lot of it, I finally found their characters believable, and I became fully intrigued in the movie as well. By this time the movie was almost over though; it does come to a pretty satisfying and entertaining conclusion at least. I think it's nice to see Hill and Franco doing diversifying work, and I think they're both good in this movie, but they're a lot better in other films (especially their comedic work; that's what they're both best at). As for the movie itself, the script could have used some more rewrites and the directing isn't that impressive either; the director and co-writer are both pretty inexperienced though (so it's somewhat understandable)."
True Story,Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/kdQGbNrUAnk
True Story,"The issue of journalistic integrity comes to the fore in this excellent story about two men who form an unlikely and bizarre friendship. Both men are emotionally damaged, both have had run-ins with authority and each identifies with the other. That one is disgraced journalist and the other a mass murderer makes the story even more intense. The movie brings out how emotions can distort reasoning and cause people to project all kinds of feelings onto another until truth becomes blurred. It is the blurring of the truth that takes place here. The movie does an outstanding job of showing how, in defiance of the intense pressure that was being applied to both men to end their communications, the friendship evolves. It occurs in stages. The details of how it happens and how it effects both men is what this movie is about. Jonah Hill and James Franco are outstanding in their respective roles as the journalist and the mass murderer. For further details, watch the movie."
True Story,"True Story is a strong movie. The film is a character driven movie which strongest element is the acting performances of Hill and Franco. True Story is a courtroom/prison drama which could have a bogged down story. However, Hill's character's desperation story about trying to save his damaged career drives the first half of True Story. True story's second half dives into Franco's character. Franco's performance of a narcissistic and sociopath killer is chilling. The Charming yet manipulative portrayal of Franco's character should earn Franco an award. A memorable indie style true crime drama. I believe we will see more of James Franco. Hill, I believe is type-casted into a lackey role. A good career move with both actors. I believe True Story will not be a commercial success, but a movie I would watch a second time."
True Story,"A true story is not necessarily an interesting one, a fact proved by this mess of a movie. The easy pickings for criticism begin with Jonah Hill – a very talented and enjoyable actor who is out of his depth in this leading role. After turning in excellent (and, to some, surprising) dramatic performances in Oscar-nominated supporting roles in Moneyball and the Wolf of Wall St., Hill, or someone in his camp, decided it was time to take a crack at a dramatic leading man role. I'm not saying he can't or won't someday be successful in that effort, but this wasn't time. Nor was it completely his fault."
True Story,"The script and the direction lack clarity and vision. And, as the two greatest opponents in any communications endeavor are confusion and boredom, True Story pulls of the cardinal double no-no. First time feature film Director Rupert Goold had a potentially interesting story and some capable talent in his hands but simply didn't execute on it. The montages that fail to advance the story in an interesting manner are just one example maddening displays of wasted opportunity. The staging is often flat. The edits, at times, seem to happen because they can rather than for any good reason. The strange thing to me is, watching this film in a packed free preview audience, there were more than a few people that seemed to think it was at least ""okay"". I could be snarky and say they got what they paid for it, but I'll take the high road. My opinion, like all, should be taken with a grain of salt."
True Story,"Hill plays Michael Finkel, a former New York Times reporter who got fired for the way he embellished a story and conflated sources to tell, what he felt, was a greater truth. I never believed Hill as a writer, though he has shown great intelligence in even some of his silliest characters previously. James Franco plays Christian Longo, who ranks among the lower level of scum of the earth for killing his wife and three kids in brutal and remorseless fashion. Felicity Jones is a fine actress whose character, Jill, seems to have some interesting things to say, but rarely gets a chance to show them. Her relationship with Hill is laughably bad. And as much as I wanted to cheer for her in the dramatic take it to Christian moment when she decides to visit him in prison (and she's there because it makes good drama?), the movie was long since gone. James Franco flashes occasionally as Longo, but I still get the feeling he was bored or partially committed too often, unwilling to throw his full weight behind what he's doing. See him in Spring Breakers to get the depth of depravity played well if you want to see this type of thing."
True Story,"The most interesting part of the movie was the courtroom scene in which Christian Longo (James Franco) pleads guilty to two murders, and innocent to the other two, all members of his own family. As the viewer, the wheels begin to turn as to what Longo's motivation and obfuscation are all about. I had a pretty good idea he was going to place his wife right in the middle of the murder scenario, and the way he laid it out, it could have been credible. Except the guy was a first class liar from the word 'go', and it took a while for Michael Finkel (Jonah Hill) to sort it all out. Longo was a great manipulator, as evidenced by the phone call with Jill (Felicity Jones) in which he tried to sweet talk another angle into getting Finkel to believe his story. I thought it was great when Jill showed up at the prison and slammed him hard for his deceit. By the end of the picture, it wasn't much of a surprise to learn that Longo did in fact, kill his entire family. But I guess the most amazing aspect of the film for me didn't have anything to do with Longo at all, it was the reason for Finkel losing his job at the New York Times. Journalistic integrity? From the newspaper that salts it's columns with statements like 'If it's true' and 'as yet we have not been able to verify'. I couldn't suppress laughing out loud."
True Story,"'True Story' explores a scary real-life incident & tries to make an awkward friendship tale out of it. Well, almost. And sadly, not all of it works, but with some powerful moments & Strong Performances going its way, the film scores on some levels."
True Story,'True Story' Synopsis: When disgraced New York Times reporter Michael Finkel (Jonah Hill) meets accused killer Christian Longo (James Franco) - who has taken on Finkel's identity - his investigation morphs into a game of cat-and-mouse.
True Story,"'True Story' begins grippingly & you're invested in the journey of these two disgraced men, one far more than the other of course. But, the pace slackens as the narrative proceeds. The second-hour lacks the punch, although the goings-on become quite intense in its penultimate moments. Nonetheless, the Writing needed some stronger stuff."
True Story,"David Kajganich & Rupert Goold's Screenplay, which is Based on the memoir of the same name by Michael Finkel, is greatly Written in parts, but doesn't come across as solid overall. As mentioned earlier, the second-hour doesn't have the moments it should have. Rupert Goold's Direction is controlled & well-done. Cinematography is atmospheric. Editing is finely done."
True Story,"Performance-Wise: Jonah Hill is in very good form, yet again! Hill, now a versatile actor known by all, sinks his teeth into the part & enacts the disgraced man, with great maturity. James Franco is top-notch. His performance is so good, that you actually want to believe him & want him free of the heinous crime he's accused of. Felicity Jones, besides looking stunning, takes a terrific turn, as the morally strong minded woman."
True Story,"On the whole, 'True Story' isn't very engaging always, but the performances are."
True Story,"...of several reasons. One of which is if you look back at the house 2015 reviews, 7+ years ago for many, they're about how Hill and Franco are so miscast as a serious writer and a charismatic creep. Well it's 2022 now and Jonah Hill, hate him or love him, has proven he is a very fine character actor and has aptitude for writing/directing as well, while Franco is basically a confirmed creep who is still somewhat charismatic. So, unlike many movies where it's the opposite, a lead's career or image has changed in a way that takes you out of it, I feel like this movie was maybe a 6.5 or so in 2015 (also just bc movies have gotten so much worse overall since) but bc of the context as well it's now a 7.5 or so imo"
True Story,"One other thing worth mentioning, and I'll say this without spoilers, but some mentioned the ending being unclear regarding Longo's actions. Please - any of you who said that please do not go outside without your special helmet and chaperone, bc I have no idea how the ending is unclear to anyone in any way."
True Story,"Overall, this was a solid character study with some interesting elements and good performances by the leads. You could do worse with your movie choice, especially because of the relatively low run time."
True Story,"No one is going to accuse this as being Oscar worthy, but I definitely recommend it."
True Story,Sometimes just because an incident is true does not mean it will translate into a good film such is the case here.
True Story,True Story stars Jonah Hill as Mike Finkel a passionate journalist who was sacked from the New York Times for embellishing a story.
True Story,James Franco plays Christian Longo a man who killed his wife and kids and when arrested on the run in Mexico he had assumed the identity of Mike Finkel.
True Story,Is Longo playing a long game in order to rope in a disgraced journalist for his own ends? Did Longo actually murder his own family or is he protecting someone else?
True Story,"Anyhow the two meet and Finkel sees this way to get himself a lucrative book deal and rehabilitate his reputation. Longo wants an exchange of favours and requires writing tips, is it creative writing?"
True Story,Obviously this quid pro quo routine brings to mind Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs but Franco is no Anthony Hopkins. In fact despite his Oscar nomination for 127 Hours and presenting the Oscars in 2011 I think he has been caught out as someone who is not that strong an actor and he is certainly not an all round entertainer.
True Story,"The film needs you to think that Longo has a sinister agenda, something to hide but there is no pay off. There is a clumsy scene where Finkel's girlfriend calls him a narcissist. A disorder that the real life killer suffers from and this was badly crow barred into the film."
True Story,The film is badly written and worse still despite being based on real events you know its not all true. Finkel in the film has doubts about Longo and realises he has been used. When the movie ends we are told that both of them still keep regularly in touch.
True Story,"In the movie business, casting is critical, both for the creative process and for a movie's potential profitability. A good cast can make a good script into a great movie or even turn a mediocre script into a good movie. A bad cast can ruin even great scripts and thwart the best directors. Of course, a cast starts with individuals – and certain questions that must be answered. Do the cast members fit their roles physically (at least coming close to what playing that character demands) and do each of the actors and actresses have the chops and, if the film is a drama, the gravitas to pull off the role? And what about perceptions? Audience members have opinions and they're the ones who vote with their dollars and determine whether a movie is ultimately a success or a failure. Simply put, will audiences in general, accept a given actor or actress in a specific role? Now, the best actors and actresses can overcome some of these potential casting problems, but very few, if any, can overcome them all. Unfortunately, the questions and issues I just raised could be seen as a problem for ""True Story"" (R, 1:40)."
True Story,"This film is the (hmmm trying not to mention the film's title too repetitively or make a bad pun here) it's the Factual Narrative behind the jailhouse conversations between journalist Michael Finkel and accused killer Christian Longo. Finkel (Jonah Hill) had just lost his job as a highly-regarded New York Times reporter for making some factual errors with a major story. Longo (James Franco) went to Mexico after allegedly murdering his wife and three small children. In Mexico, Longo was giving his name as ""Mike Finkel"", including at the time of his arrest. When Finkel hears about this, he travels from his cabin in Montana to a county jail in Oregon to ask Longo ""Why""? Why Longo appropriated Finkel's name and, somewhat more importantly, why Longo murdered his own family. Does Longo genuinely just admire Finkel, or is he taking advantage of Finkel's desperation for a new writing gig and current reputation for playing fast and loose with the facts to use Finkel for his own ends. And DID Longo murder his family? Much of the film portrays the encounters between Finkel and Longo. Finkel uses various techniques to get to know Longo and draw out his story. Longo talks to Finkel regularly, but he also writes long letters to Finkel – with pictures. Finkel writes back, and continues to visit Longo in jail – the only reporter to whom Longo will talk. Finkel soon decides that Longo's story is more than a newspaper article that he can try selling to the highest bidder, but rather a book that he can try selling to the highest bidder. Longo agrees to tell Finkel his story as long as it isn't published until after the trial and if Finkel will give Longo writing lessons. An exchange of favors and information begins – and develops into a kind of friendship. Finkel, seeing the potential for a big payday wants to get Longo's entire story and, chastened by his recent fall from grace, knows he needs to get the story right – a goal that becomes more complicated than it sounds. Finkel's girlfriend, Jill (Felicity Jones) supports him but is concerned that he might be giving Longo too much leeway and too big of a benefit of the doubt in the pursuit of truth."
True Story,"""True Story"" suffers from poor casting and a meaningless story. Hill is a good actor (with two Oscar nominations) and Franco is an adequate actor (with one nom). Both are known more for comedies. Knowing their resumes and that they're friends in real life, seeing them sitting across from each other in totally serious roles was distracting. I just kept imagining them laughing between takes or about to break into comic banter in the midst of the drama. But maybe that's just me. More importantly, were they each up to the dramatic challenge? Again, in my opinion, no. Franco's acting wasn't sinister enough to make me think he was dangerous, intense enough to make me believe he was innocent or deep enough to convince me he was serious. Hill I just couldn't buy as a seasoned journalist. Same with the Oregon reporter played by Ethan Suplee, who is also known mainly for his comedic acting. Jones was good, as was Robert John Burke playing a cop, but that wasn't enough."
True Story,"My other big problem with ""True Story"" is that it just didn't have much of a point. It's a little bit ""Primal Fear"" and a little bit ""The Usual Suspects"", but the script wasn't as smart, the characters as engaging or the ending nearly as satisfying as those earlier films. This movie literally settles for a wink and a nod when it could have said something interesting about our legal system or at least given us a few thrills on the way to its lackluster conclusion. This movie isn't terrible, but it's not very good either. I'm giving this one a ""C"". I'm not recommending it (like something in the ""B"" or ""A"" range), but I don't think it deserves trashing (""D"" or ""F""). I hope you'll decide for yourself. If you do see the movie, come back and tell me what you thought. I really welcome any and all comments – good, bad or indifferent. True Story!"
Roy,"The cast and the music had a magnetic effect on me. But once the film reel began rolling, I was experiencing symptoms of depression and schizophrenia."
Roy,"Roy starts and ends on one single note: blankness. While I am still trying to figure out what the writer intended by conveying such a senseless story, I have not yet recovered from the trauma I had after sitting through two and a half hours of nothingness. Vikramjit Singh's characters are pretentiously polished: Arjun Rampal as an arrogant writer and director who uses a typewriter, Jacqueline Fernandez as a book-loving, reserved filmmaker, and Ranbir Kapoor as a (mute) thief who drives around in a convertible, you know, for the effect. Yes, Kapoor has a total of fifteen dialogs (including ""Ooh,"" ""Aah,"" and ""Aao"") in the film. (Also, if you observe, the beginning credits introduces Kapoor to be in a ""dynamic role."" What does the director mean by this? If ever I meet the amateur Vikramjit Singh in a coffee house, I'll make sure that I ask him this question and write a piece about it verbatim.)"
Roy,"The thief in the film introduces himself as a thief so that we don't misconstrue the makers as thieves for robbing us off through the ticket costs. This happens in less than twenty minutes into it, and I did not need any more proof to consider how bad the film was gonna be. Even if I forgo the snail-paced narration, I cannot forgive Singh for botching up the screenplay. It has the worst screenplay I have seen all this year, and it is a good thing from a Bollywood point of view. The story constructed is so choppy, I bet you will turn to your therapist after watching it."
Roy,"Bad cinematography and good photography mix together and bring out blues in the exotic locales the film has been shot in. The dialogs are plain bad, and so is the cast performance. Only Rampal comes out as an average player."
Roy,"If you want me to tell it, then, yes, the music and songs are good. Period. But the score is repetitive, often sampling many of the songs' melodies. I bet most of us have seen the best parts of the movie in the trailer, and if you were to divide Roy, as a film, into two parts: one as the trailer, and one as the film intrinsically, you would have two polarizing videos."
Roy,"BOTTOM LINE: There is not an iota of thrill in the storyline, nor is the story fathomable. Roy only looks good in the trailer, and for a moment there, I even thought the whole film was a tediously long advertisement for Godrej lockers and CCTV cameras. Regretlessly Avoidable!"
Roy,Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES
Roy,"This is my first movie review on any forum. First, I would like to thank all the Dim wits, who have given this movie negative publicity through negative review. Had it not been for them, i would have never got down to actually writing this review."
Roy,"The movie, technically, is almost flawless, so engrossing that had it any flaws I did not notice."
Roy,It sets the mood from the word go and sticks with it. The editing is clever ( where most people are getting confused ). The screen play ( narrative is quite unusual for bollywood) Casting could not have been more perfect. Background Music score is very good. stays with the story - sets the mood.
Roy,For Mature audiences who love good cinema.
Roy,If you are looking for a POPCORN thriller this is definitely not the movie for you...definitely not for teeny boppers or Romantic comedy buffs.
Roy,"Excellent dialogues , excellent Music ( Songs)"
Roy,I was going to give it an 8 rating but then decided on 9 after realizing this is vikramjits Directorial debut.
Roy,Good Luck to Vikram....already looking out for your next venture.
Roy,"I was not expecting much from this movie after reading reviews but I still took my chance and I watched it. It was definitely worth watching.. This movie is not for the masala (spice) seeking people, this movie is for sensible people to put their brain into it and enjoy the journey. I am thrilled by the Arjun's performance, Jacqueline Fernandez was just an eye candy to me but Ranbir's performance took it to another level and made me see the stars in daylight. If you like silly Salman Khan's movies then this is not your cup or tea but if you like Nasir-ud-din shah, Irfan Khan and Pakistan Cinema's movies (not Lollywood) then this is your type of movie to watch. You need a brain to watch, understand and appreciate this film. Enjoy!"
Roy,I can't believe this kind of movie is also make in India.
Roy,"One of d best movie of Arjun Rampal and superb work by vikramjit singh. Movie is slow, but this is speciality of the movie and work of the actors even worth of rating 8.0 . Expressions of Arjun was so real Ranbeer played as he and Arjun both are exactly the same inside out. Everything is perfect but just end is expected thats why I gave only 8.0 rating. This movie is for those peoples which don't have time for 3 hours Bollywood movie they have exactly 146 minutes to see a video. This movie for those peoples who want to spend their time only for a good direction and acting not for as usual bollywood masala."
Roy,"Trailer and promo were reflecting that there is some mystery and thrill but after fifteen minutes of film you get the sense that there is nothing, you are victim of a boring stuff in the name of creativity. This is complex representation of a simple and many time seen concept. There is a dialogue in film that says that there is a type of film, which is only made for the sake of makers, without caring of audience, this line is appropriate for this film itself. Complete film is full of parallel cuts without any story line and emotions. It must have sounded fancy just at the idea level. Good actor Ranbir Kapoor gone waste. He had nothing to do. Sometimes I couldn't understand that what push them to do such type of film. Arjun Rampal is OK. Hindi does not suit a bit to Jacqueline Fernandez but she had make to speak difficult words even when it was not required for her character. It irritates more than her performance less acting."
Roy,"I'm writing this in 2018, but I just had to.
'Roy' is a terrific film with great performances, especially from Arjun Rampal, Jacqueline Fernandez, and Ranbir Kapoor. Ranbir Kapoor has gotten a lot of hate for his performance, for no reason really. Not all of his performances have to be energetic, charismatic, or cheeky. He is very subdued here, which is a refreshing change of pace, especially for an actor of his caliber.
Do not watch this film, thinking it is an action thriller. It is a drama that is slow-paced, but all the better for it. It has a unique story which I wont spoil. But it involves the constant switching from fiction to reality and back to fiction again until the cycle repeats itself.
The problem is, this is a film that is kind of artsy and is more suitable in the indie film category. This is most definitely not a mainstream film, which is a shame because 'Roy' offers a very different and unique viewing experience where there is a lot to discover.
Its a shame that Virkamjit Singh has not made another movie since then, as I am very interested in what he can bring to Bollywood. My best guess is that studios do not want to invest in him, as they're only looking at the box-office records. While that is important, there should however be room for some different and engaging content. This is something I dont undersatnd about film criticism: Critics are constantly denouncing cliched story-lines and generic films, but when approached with one that is unique and different, critics trash it.
Sorry about the rant. The point is to give 'Roy' a chance and view it without expectations or pre-conceived notions."
Roy,"A gun,A car and a woman is enough to make a film. This famous quote of Godard is the inspiration of this movie ( probably). From the very beginning of the movie you will know that this is not something familiar, this is something else. The plot is really well edited and placed with absolute precision. The entrance of a alter ego,the writer's block and the love of his life,these three elements try to create a labyrinth of shadow and lights in their life,and by some means, the director is successful. Maybe that is why some people are saying this movie is a disaster, because they failed to understand the agony of a writer, his lack of navigation in a complicated plot. The film is a 'film noir' genre and there is no action in this piece of art,so the genre box featuring ACTION is misleading.India will not understand the value of ROY,but I guess after someday they will join the fraternity of good films."
Roy,"people didn't like the film because they didn't understand what is it but believe me if you watch it with carefully you will definitely love it. Film have two plots, one is about director Kabir & and his failed love life, his writer's block. second is about Roy which is nothing but Kabir's script we see on screen. people didn't understand what was that & they criticized this masterpiece. I found Kabir's character very similar to Guido Anselmi (Marcello Mastroianni in 8 1/2). Arjun Rampal also did this character effectively. Film brilliantly shows directors condition in writer's block, failed love. Director Vikramjit Singh is must be great fan of world cinema & want to made something like that in India cinema. its sad his first effort failed but believe me after 10 years will be called as classic."
Roy,"I always see the reviews before i go for any movie . Considering the reviews of this movie to be sensible I did not watch this movie for a long time . And I regret so much about it that I am writing my first ever review for ROY. Roy doesn't deserve the kind of hate it received . This movie is totally a must watch. It is a beautiful movie with excellent cinematography ,direction and actors. Its something WORTH giving two and a half hours of your life ."
Roy,"Roy is a movie which talks about the working of a creative mind. writer and director kabir grewal played by Arjun ram pal writes a script for his movie guns part 3 while shooting his film. the movie is moving at the right pace and was not at all boring. Ranbir Kapoor and Arjun Rampal are complemented well by Jacqueline Fernandez, the movie is very different from mainstream Bollywood and in future is probably going to be a milestone in Bollywood. the film gives you stints of what you would expect from someone like a David Fincher. I feel that Vikramjit malik should have probably not added those item numbers just to add the Bollywood touch and should have gone all out with his different approach in making films. Nevertheless brilliant movie!. 10/10"
Roy,"I saw the movie.. RATED it 10. Yes. I was going to rate it 8 or 9. I came to IMDb after watching the movie and guessed that this movie would have got 8 or 9 stars on an average. But F*ck!. We Indians(Not All) just like Masala Movies. In other words, Sh*t movies. I've seen some really sh*tty movies and this is not one of those."
Roy,"Arjun, Ranbir and Jaqueline were truly amazing and did their part well. Genre is drama so you're not gonna find typical Bollywood masala here. You ask Bollywood to grow up and make some sensible movies but when they do you just end up either mocking or hating it. We're all just a bunch of hypocrites."
Roy,"If someone asked you if you liked Inception or Interstellar or even Gravity, you'd probably say it was one of the best movies you've ever seen even though it bored you to death, or you didn't like the idea of the film or it just went over your EMPTY head because these movies have already been rated the best so you go with the flow and accept it even if you liked it or not."
Roy,Actually like or dislike is subjective but seriously the hatred and bad mouthing is what bothers me the most. Hope if you haven't seen this movie and want to watch then do give it a try. The bias is totally unnecessary.
Roy,Stop Following!
Roy,This is my first review. I had to write it because this is the movie I stepped out of in an hour even when I had no other plans. It's awful.
Roy,Take your money and meticulously tear it into 100 small pieces. You'll get more mental stimulation from that than watching this movie.
Roy,"I don't know why people are overreacting against the movie, either they couldn't understand the plot or they are following the dumb crowd. People cry for movies of diff concepts like Hollywood and when they get one they start talking $hit about it. Had ROY been directed by Christopher Nolan all these idiots would have clapped their ass off, no matter whether they understand the movie or not :P"
Roy,"Two nicely written stories are going side by side , nice cinematography , awesome songs what else do you want? I would suggest you guys to go watch the movie once and decide it by yourself. If you can watch those movies mentioned above in the summary section you can always give it a try."
Roy,"After Long time I watched good movie in Bollywood but its for specific people. Dialogues deliveries are awesome, really liked. Good work done by Director/writer Vikramjeet Singh. This movie is not for impatient people. In Bollywood we usually watch action/dramatic movies with same sort of stories but Roy is much more than Romance or thriller. Finally Bollywood movies started entering in different concept. Arjun Rampal, Ranbir Kapoor and Jacqueline played their role as story's demand.This is a movie that demands your brain to be involved while watching it. I am sure 'Roy' is a story that will remember me for long time. Please don't listen anyone just go and watch."
Roy,"spoiler alert: I have to add this spoilers to make people understand the complex story so that they can go to the cinema to enjoy it, instead of wasting time in reading the nonsense reviews floating around describing Roy as worst movie ever."
Roy,"First of all: Ranbir Kapoor has made a great choice opting for Roy. The introduction mentions his character as a dynamic one, and the reason is his character does not exist in real life - it exists in the story that Arjun is writing and the movie that Arjun is making as director. He is the protagonist of Arjun Kapoor's story about a thief. He is an alter ego of Arjun. Arjun is a director writing his script for his third film of a trilogy on Roy - the master art thief. This time he is going through writers block - as in not able to build up the story. Roy is his alter ego, so Roy's story is not progressing because Arjun's life is not progressing from a boring life. He has got a producer but does not have a script. So he decides to build the script impromptu as his life shapes up in upcoming days. And accordingly life of Roy starts inside his mind, in his typewriter and through the film shootings for his third film where he has taken a lookalike of Ayesha- the girl he mèts in Malyasia and also taken a lead actor who is Ranbie KapoorLife of Roy is full of thrills when Arjun is having excitement in real life, Life of Roy is enjoying at a beach with a lookalike of Ayesha, when Arjun is relaxing at a beach with real Ayesha - Jaqline. Life of Roy is stranded in middle of a sea when Arjun is distanced from Ayesha and mourning the distance. When Arjun makes a decision to start afresh getting over Ayesha, Ranvir as continueRoy returns to the shore with his ship."
Roy,"The whole idea of a writers block and the main protagonist in the story written by the writer to be the writer's alter ego, has been beautifully portrayed in the movie. The director, as it seems feared what is happening now. People in India and critics in India do not seem to have understood the idea and is therefore thinking its a film that switches between two different story lines continuously. It does not, each time you see Roy on screen, it is to show the psychological state of Arjun and the way his life is traversing. The police officer wadia in Roy's story is like the world around Arjun trying to figure out him. The director at some scenes have bluntly tried to say this to the audience. But as it seems, the Indian audience who can grasp the complexities of movies like inception decided not to use their brains while watching a bollywood movie. The part where it proves that Roy is more than the character of Arjun's story and film is when Arjun has completed his last movie of Roy but still you can see Roy as the life of Arjun continues to progress."
Roy,"The movie, I agree, has less of action and thrill compared to the thrill and mystery shown in the trailers. But thats about it - a misleading trailer for a wonderful movie. The movie is a romantic story and a man's alter ego for getting the thrills in his otherwise boring life."
Roy,"If I have to divide the movie in phases then it has six phases. 1. Arjun with his writers block 2. Arjun getting the idea of writing a story about art heist in Malyasia after listening to a similar news on TV. This is from where Roy's journey starts 3. Arjun meets Jaqueline, introduces female character in his film shoot and story of Roy. Roy now starts to plan to steal the lady's art collection while Arjun starts to steal Jaqueline's heart. 4. Arjun and Jaqueline falls in love and Roy's story also progresses to the point where Roy steals the art. Jaqueline understands that Arjun used her as inspiration to complete Roy's story and abandons him, Roy stays stranded in middle of ocean now. 5. Arjun faces big personal life issues helping him to overcome loss of love from Jaqueline. Roy returns to shore and the story gets completed. Film is launched with success 6. Arjun reunites with Jaqueline and Roy returns the art back to the lady to be reunited in love."
Roy,"The whole movie runs with a nice musical tone building up Roy's mysterical character. Its a movie that tests the intelligence of the audience. While some may find it complex story telling, those who understand it would find it intriguing."
Roy,Please go and watch this masterpiece. Congratulations to the entire cast of Roy and the breaveheart director for attempting this in Indian cinema.
Roy,"If you are looking for awww... choo shweet type of love story then this movie disappoints you totally. If you think Kick, Happy New Year,Raone, KKHH, KKKG, Ready (basically SRK, Karan Johar, Rohit Shetty type of Sh*t) is a good movie then please stay out of this movie otherwise you will be doing an injustice to a piece of art. This movie is for art and cinema lovers. For those who really want Indian cinema and filmmaker to grow up. If you have an optimum level of intellect then please watch this movie, you will definitely love this. The movie beautifully executed with parallel story. Some amazing nature and seascapes shots, and a lot of depth in it. Some good songs and music. Acting is satisfactory overall."
Roy,"Fifty minutes in to the movie I started to ask the question 'What is going on here? Where is the movie I was promised by the trailer?' Nearly all the scenes that were in the trailer have been played out by now. You could stare at Jacqueline or Ranbir or Arjun and you could sing along with the chart buster songs. That's it, that's all you can do in the theater after the first 20 minutes or so. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen more than what the movie has to offer."
Roy,"Somewhere in the 'intellectual' dialogs and sleek, stylish cinematography lies buried the dreams of an amateur director with a lot of potential. Vikramjit Singh will need a lot more nurturing before he can make a coherent movie. I have nothing to spoil the plot, that is how bad the movie is. I would give this 0 out of 10 just because the promise was not delivered upon."
Roy,I have been fortunate enough to know people who have made 15 minute short films with more sense and better vision. None of the actors are at fault although one would not have expected Ranbir Kapoor to be part of such a movie. Maybe even he was fooled by the seemingly engrossing premise like the rest of us.
Roy,"To begin with, it's not a movie for comedy watchers. The movie is not focused on entertainment solely."
Roy,It's a love story of a man who had lived not so normal life. A man who understood the meaning of love with time.
Roy,"The characters have acted superbly, with few exceptions. Arjun is awesome. Ranbir should be appreciated for taking this role. The story telling has been taken to the next level."
Roy,"You need to watch it with complete focus to appreciate this movie and the effort put in to make it. A few plot could have been edited to keep it straight. The movie conveys a social message of love and affection. Overall, I would rate it pretty high for the acting, music, locations, and acting. Must watch movie for new age movie goers."
Roy,Roy is a pathetic attempt by the debut director Vikramjit Singh. It is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. Poor script with equally poor direction will make you pull your hair even before the interval of the movie. The talents of Arjun Rampal and Ranbir have been completely wasted. The viewer will never get a hang of what is happening on the screen. The narration is equally pathetic. There are a lot of continuity errors in the movie making the viewer puzzled.
Roy,The songs of the movie are good.
Roy,The only point for which one should go to watch Roy is the beauty of Jacqueline Fernandez.
Roy,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND PRECIOUS TIME WATCHING ROY.
Roy,The people who are bashing this movie clearly didn't understand it. Or maybe they are fans of cheap and fake movies like Ashique 2 and Dabbang 53. This is by far Arjun Rampals best performance. He didn't get overshadowed by Ranbir Kapoor. Jacqueline was promising and played a very different role as compared to what we have seen her doing over the years. You need to have a cool head and be a little patient to wait for the movie to unfold completely and understand it. The director has very smartly placed hints in small bits & pieces which will help you understand the movie. Overall I am very happy that they are making movies like this in India. It's a movie for those people who like to watch something different and don't just walk to the theaters to watch item numbers and cheap action sequences.
Roy,"I had many expectations from this film, 'Roy'. But it proved to be an extremely senseless, illogical, third class, and a boring film."
Roy,"There is lack of comedy, suspense, thrill and a proper script & story which was expected to take a good grip. The entire film is filled with useless and non-sense dialogues. All audience in the hall were wondering like when something will 'happen' in this movie. The part before interval contained only dialogues n dialogues....though some of the songs were nice."
Roy,"You better avoid this film at any costs. If you want to watch this movie, watch it only and only if you can't get good sleep at home, or your air conditioner is damaged! You may give it a try if you want but at your own risk!"
Roy,IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW WORST MOVIES ARE LOOK LIKE... THAN WATCH IT
Roy,"Its not a movie. Its look like a dream of another person and you are forced to watch it on the screen but you don't know that person, you don't know the characters of the dream even if you try to understand what is going on you cant. I went to theater and what i see after half an hour most of the people left the theater and remaining one talking to each other and chatting, drinking eating snakes and there was atmosphere like a marriage party and no one looking at the screen. I survived for around 70 minutes but after that... it was too much..and i left ....:) so i think everybody should try to watch this movie for taking worst movies experience. LOL"
Roy,"Terrible idea to cast Arjun Rampal, he is just not convincing in the role of a filmmaker!"
Roy,"Leading lady Jacqueline Fernandez looks gorgeous but that we knew even before Roy released, the poor writing doesn't give her anything to do."
Roy,The best talent of the lot Ranbir Kapoor is wasted in this film and how! A star his level better have a good reason to do Roy!
Roy,The best part of the film is the music but the songs come so abruptly and are totally out of place for anyone to enjoy.
Roy,Roy is a painful trudge through acres of pretentious hollowness.
Roy,Neither the two dapper leading actors nor an eager-to-please heroine in a double role can rescue the film from its inexorable downhill trundle.
Roy,"It deals with writing and painting on one level, and with philandering and thievery on the other."
Roy,"First things first, this is not a Ranbir Kapoor movie, he is in an extended cameo, so don't get fooled by all those posters and advertisements. If you watch this movie (which I suggest you shouldn't) you will actually be thankful that this is not a Ranbir Kapoor movie, because nobody wants a brilliant actor like Ranbir to be associated with a movie so pathetic and dragged that for a minute you actually start thinking Dhoom 3 was a watchable movie. Its really tiring to sit through the 150 minutes, I actually went out of the theater twice. There is nothing good happening in the movie, there is only the long shots, the gloomy colors, the monotonousness of the frames, the dragged plot. The actors do nothing except sit and exchange philosophical disclosures that has nothing to do with the film. Both Arjun Rampal and Jacqueline Fernandez are supposed to be film-makers who are making their own films, but still what all we see is them roaming here and there, drinking wine and singing and partying (this is precisely the reason why we are getting such horrible movies from bollywood nowadays)."
Roy,"Even after watching the movie I am not quite sure about what really was the motive behind the movie (none as far as I can see), it might also be because I did not care at all for the movie after an hour or so, I was just sitting there because I had paid for the film."
Roy,"To anyone who is thinking of going to watch this movie, take a pair of headphones you will need them or rather do not go, wait for a while and soon it will premiere on TV."
Roy,"Why did I watched Roy... mostly because of my trust on Ranbeer Kappor... But then I asked myself what is he doing in such a movie. Then I asked what is anybody doing in this movie... and then I asked what am I doing in the theatare. But in spite of repeated temptations to leave the theatare, I survived till the end, mainly because I hoped something will happen. but that's the trouble. Nothing at all happens in the movie. From start to end, in most of the scenes there is only one character on screen, generally smoking or drinking. the dialogues and monologues(there are a lot of monologues) are not natural. A lot of scenes, if not all, are unnecessary. there are hardly 4-5 characters in the movie (including both real and imaginary characters), out of which 2 are played by Jacklin. First Jacklin is the sri lankan beauty we know ( that came as a relief) other Jacklin is wearing some kind of makeup which is making her look like a vampire. Songs are good... but their placement is so abrupt in the two and a half hour movie , and you are so bored with the movie that you can hardly enjoy them. Locations are good, but monotonous dark and gloomy picturization spoils them too. I can understand that the director did not wanted to make a Bollywood masala movie, but trust me, this movie is not above Masala, This is way below Masala. Conclusion: Don't watch this movie even if you are paid for it."
Chappie,"Concerns over the use of drones to kill people and the use of military equipment by police make Neill Blomkamp's ""Chappie"" more relevant. The use of an all-robot police force recalls ""RoboCop"", while the concept of a droid who has human qualities brings to mind ""Short Circuit"" and ""AI: Artificial Intelligence""*. Although some scenes in the movie come across as silly, I interpreted it as a warning about over-reliance on technology for law enforcement. The South African setting makes sense: four decades of institutionalized racism gave way to one of the highest crime rates in the developed world."
Chappie,"In the end, I recommend the movie. It's understood that Chappie simply wants to be able to live like everyone else. The plot holes don't drag the movie down at all. Sharlto Copley, Dev Patel (of ""Slumdog Millionaire""), Sigourney Weaver and Hugh Jackman put on fine performances."
Chappie,"*Another movie focusing on a robot with human qualities is ""Robot & Frank"", starring Frank Langella and Susan Sarandon."
Chappie,"If there was ever a movie that needed a sequel more than another, it's Chappie."
Chappie,"It's literally probably the best movie I've ever seen, still (and it's 2021 as of this update/writing)."
Chappie,"I've seen Short Circuit many times before, and it's hard to deny that Chappie is extremely reminiscent of that film. The biggest difference between the two is that the people who end up in possession of Chappie are the most annoying human beings in South Africa. I know that Die Antwoord is a thing down there, but I swear their faux ""gangsta"" personalities are even more offensive than Fisher Stevens playing an Indian man. Every moment they were on screen, I was annoyed and wishing they would shut up. Then at the end, for some reason, they expect us to fear for their lives. I was anxious for them to die and stop ruining the movie. The funny thing is Hugh Jackman is also delivering a ridiculously over-the-top performance, but I didn't mind at all. It works coming from him, and he's supposed to be the villain anyways."
Chappie,"The sad truth is, there's a decent film at the heart of Chappie. The visual effects of the robot are amazing, and Sharlto Copley's motion capture and voice work are brilliant. He embodies the innocence of a robot with an infantile mind to perfection. I also thought Dev Patel worked well as the brains behind the robots, and his conflict with Chappie made sense and created the one effective emotional arc in the film. It's just too bad that Neill Blomkamp decided to build the story around his friends Yo-Landi and Ninja instead of simply concentrating on what would make for the best film. I want to like this movie more, and it has a number of elements that I did enjoy. But I will probably just go back to watch Short Circuit or Robocop to get all the same story beats in a better film, despite the fact that Chappie had potential to be on par with one of those movies."
Chappie,"In Johannesburg, the police department reduced the high rating of criminality using robots from the Tetravaal Company, designed by the engineer Deon Wilson (Dev Patel). The former military Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) is envious of Deon, since he has developed another project called Moose, but neither Tetravaal nor the police department is interested. Deon has just developed an Artificial Intelligence but the Tetravaal's CEO Michelle Bradley (Sigourney Weaver) asks him to abort the project. Deon decides to bring the damaged Robot 22 that was sent to be crushed to test his A.I. However he is kidnapped by the criminals Ninja (Ninja), Yo-Landi (¥o-Landi Vi$$er) and Amerika (Jose Pablo Cantillo) that want him to stop the robot cops. When they see the damaged robot in the van, they force Deon to program it to heist banks with them and they call it Chappie. However, Chappie acts like a child and need to be trained to learn and grow. Meanwhile Vincent follows Deon and plots an evil scheme to activate his robot."
Chappie,"""Chappie"" is a flawed but entertaining film with ""robocops"" fighting against crime. However, Tetravaal is totally unbelievable as a security company with the easy access of employees to the facility and software. Considering that all Johannesburg is dependable of the robots, it is ridiculous the lack of protection of the company and how easy Deon Wilson and Vincent Moore go there during the night and access the systems using only a key. The concern of Chappie with mortality and the discussion with his creator is taken from ""Blade Runner"". The corny decision of Deon, running after Chappie instead of activating the robots in the chaotic city is also silly. My vote is seven."
Chappie,"Title (Brazil): ""Chappie"""
Chappie,"Chappie is an interesting film because it could be ridiculed for random themes and inconsistent story, or it could be praised for the fact that it brings up a lot of ambitious ideas and concepts."
Chappie,"It is a really interesting film as far as themes go. The movie brings up a lot of ideas that aren't brought up in most ""AI"" films such as: Does the robot recognize his own mortality? Does the robot feel guilt? How does the robot react to having one parent being a criminal and the other parent being a respectful scientist? There were a lot of scenes where I was thinking ""Dang, this could lead to a pretty cool concept""."
Chappie,"Unfortunately, the movie never fleshes out any of its themes."
Chappie,"It is always very sad to see a movie like this: A movie that has all the right elements to be good, but it gets too distracted in being too many things so it never gets any of the elements right. For example, one of the ingenious themes is the fact that Chappie has two parents: A scientist and a very violent thug. On one side Chappie is learning about the basics of language and how to be a model citizen, but on the other side he is learning how to properly mug people, how to fight, how to talk cool, how to walk cool, and how to earn respect from other people. This is very interesting because the movie never starts Chappie out as super intelligent, it starts him out as a very quick learning child. This means you can see him slowly learn and make connections between every event in his life."
Chappie,"A great example of this is Chappie is told that knives make people go to sleep, so naturally Chappie tries to stab people until he is told that they don't want to go to sleep. However, when Chappie starts stabbing people later, you see him pause and looks into someone's eyes and say ""I'm sorry, I didn't know. Don't go to sleep"". But he says it very quietly so that no one else can hear."
Chappie,"These are some very deep and interesting themes and Chappie is a very interesting character. Unfortunately, it never fleshes out its themes. This means a lot of very profound themes will fly by in about five minutes and not show up later. This also brings us to one hilarious big issue with the movie:"
Chappie,"Every scene involving the villain makes little to no sense. It's not that I don't mind Hugh Jackman, or the approach they were taking, it was how insane and over the top he becomes. He is supposed to be playing a local engineer/scientist who wants to make human controlled mechs that are grossly over-powered for the job of law enforcement. Instead of modifying his idea and making it work for the job, he still says that law-enforcement needs a mech with... mini-guns, claws, machine guns, rockets, cluster missiles, and just about anything you can think of. It really makes no sense to want that on the street. This brings up several questions: Why not just sell it to the military? He does work for a weapons company so if not law enforcement why not military (He was hinted at being an ex- solider/Veteran). So his obsession doesn't really make sense: If he really wants human controlled machines, then make one less overpowered. If he really wants an overpowered mech, then sell it to the military."
Chappie,"However, because he doesn't do either of these, he becomes an insane psychopath who literally shuts down all of the security/robots in the city just to prove that they need heavier firepower for the job. This brings up a lot of plot-holes: How was he able to do this so easily? Any company (even your local cable company) can track a computer that is shutting down other equipment. How did no one notice him doing this? Why didn't the protagonist tell anyone else that he was doing this? How was he able to gruesomely kill fairly innocent people, while laughing, and no one in the office space took notice? This element of the movie truly absurd and doesn't even fit into the plot. He really is a shoe-horned villain. Just about anyone else could've been the villain and it would've made more sense. Why not the ring-leader from the beginning? He said he wanted to shut- down all of the robots? Several other people were looking for a remote to shutdown all of the robots, so literally anyone could've been the villain and would've had better motives than Hugh Jackman."
Chappie,"Other than that, the ending is a bit random, but I was okay with it until the last minute or so. The very very end is kind of... okay? That doesn't make sense with the universe's set rules, but... okay... Fortunately, the other characters in this movie are pretty good. Some people may find them annoying, but I found it interesting because its not like Chappie fell into the hands of perfect people who knew how to use him, Chappie fell into the hands of people who have no idea how robots work or the science behind them. So certain people attach to him differently. Some people treat him like a human, while others do not."
Chappie,"All in all, a smarter than your average film, but full of plot-holes and issues. Kind of sad, really."
Chappie,"Johannesburg Police are using robots called scouts, supplied by Tetravaal Corporation. Software engineer Deon develops a self-aware artificial intelligence which he smuggles into a defunct robot. This childlike – but learning - being ends up kidnapped by a group of petty gangsters who plan to use it for criminal purposes. Meanwhile, back at Tetravaal, ex-military man Vincent Moore is championing an enormous and viciously militaristic robot as the next step in robotic law enforcement."
Chappie,"Chappie is like Robocop crossed with Pinocchio, with a touch of Terminator and Pygmalion thrown in, and all run through a pronounced Saath Efrikan filter. Much is very good – lots goes on, performances are very good, effects are great (I suspect Chappie himself is a mixture of CGI, costume, animatronic and puppetry, but they are all mixed together so well that you simply accept his physical reality throughout. It is often very funny, sometimes very touching, and has an ending – several endings – which I didn't see coming, and which I very much liked."
Chappie,"Less positively, the strongly South African setting is both understandable and reasonable, but I found it somewhat distracting, the Vodacom tower product placement was annoying, the physical appearance affected by Yolandi (which, I understand, is part of her schtick) was profoundly irritating, and Moore's descent into psychotic body-shredding scenery-chewing mode was somewhere between improbable and unbelievable."
Chappie,"On the whole, though, this was an enjoyable romp."
Chappie,"If a movie has a robot in it, that is part cop, the comparisons with Robocop won't be hard to find. But this is a different beast altogether. Trying to get into a discussion about machines, souls and after-life. Not everything gels in perfectly and nicely. But the director does a good job with a lot of elements. Something that might have spun out of control, but it didn't."
Chappie,"While the name Chappie might remind some of dog (food) and I can only guess that was intended, there is more to Chappie than just being a ""pet"". Chappie is getting and learning things fast as you'd expect and the lines between good and evil blur at times, if not through the whole movie. That might be tough to handle or accept for some, but if you do roll with it, you'll see a very entertaining movie, that can give you food for thought ..."
Chappie,"I thoroughly enjoyed Chappie. I usually don't write reviews, but after seeing the brutal rating this movie is getting I felt compelled to write this review."
Chappie,"Chappie is a funny, entertaining, and surprisingly sentimental movie about a sentient robot being raised by gangsters in Johannesburg. Most of the criticisms I've seen about one- dimensional characters and illogical character choices are valid, but Chappie's character, the CGI, the humor, and the overall aesthetic of the movie more than make up for these shortcomings."
Chappie,"Please go see this movie and make up your own mind. I almost didn't go last night because of the negative reviews, but I'm so happy I did. I'm very excited to see this movie again. You leave this movie feeling like you've become friends with Chappie, and I hope the bad reviews don't prevent the sequels from being made."
Chappie,If you like Neill Blomkamp's directing and style you will love this movie.
Chappie,"I went to watch it because I like scifi and AI/robot theme TV/movies in general. Some I hate (Her, A.I.) some I love (Blade Runner, Battlestar remake, Wall-E). This one, I love. I didn't have an opinion about Neill Blomkamp. Didn't even know Hugh Jackman is in this movie so it was a pleasant surprise."
Chappie,"I was emotionally moved and entertained. Chappie is one of - no, THE MOST action-packed YET emotionally-engaging and HEARTFUL movies I've watched in a while, no bored moments and no time for going into meta-analysis. Can't believe I cared about a clunky metalic wire-ly robot, haven't since the far-cuter Wall-E anyway."
Chappie,"Dev Pattel is well cast, did the role total justice. Sigourney did her part with just the right note. Hugh succeeded in compressing his bigger-than-life self into an unglamorous (even unflattering) thug-in-cubicle-job role. Very noble of him, lending his superstar weight to this project. (showing Mr.BirdMan how a real-life hero gracefully bow out of superhero phase of his film role)"
Chappie,"In spite of the tension from start to end, people burst out laughing A LOT throughout. There were lots of humor, but nothing contrived, just Grade AAA seamless storytelling. And if the key characters act crazy, it is explained why, without being captain obvious. Dialogs and expositions, 99% SHOW vs tell, Mckee would be proud, not that it mattered against the hateful bigots of pro critics Borg contingent. I decided somewhere along 20 minutes in - I REALLY like this directorial voice."
Chappie,"The technical bits: the story craft, the plotting, pacing, editing, art directing, effects, all superb and SEAMLESSLY EXECUTED. Zero complaint there. My only beef is as usual the theological stuff but I will not trash something this brilliant because it doesn't agree with my spiritual viewpoint."
Chappie,"Side note on IRRELEVANCY OF RT CRITIC SCORE (and probably Academy Self-Awards) I never cared about Rotten Tomatos score but my other half love to check it after every movie. We both anticipated the critics will be hateful with this one because it features a non-American director and 2 non-American male leads! But we didn't expect the shamelessness level. At least the audience disagreed by a HUGE margin, and the audience WORLDWIDE will continue to disagree as the box office telly of Rest of The World come in. This movie is trashed due to PURE POLITICAL reason. DUH. There are some really tightly-wound-up, bitter ANALysts in the mainstream ""art"" critic scene, who have forgotten how to feel sentient, and lost touch with everything, obviously."
Chappie,"Anyway, go watch it, just for entertainment. If you happen to be moved then it is a bonus. It will prove that you have a heart, and more sentient than the average Borgs who's tied into ""networked group mind"" opinions."
Chappie,Meanwhile I totally look forward to a sequel. 9/10. +1 just to annoy the art-haters.
Chappie,"""Chappie"" transports us into the near future, where the high crime rate in Johannesburg, South Africa calls for the acquisition of a series of armor-plated, artificially intelligent, humanoid robots that serve as the town's indestructible police force. The robots cannot be hacked and are trained to shoot, arrest, and detain law-breaking citizens. The robot's designer Deon Wilson (Dev Patel), a young and successful engineer, is detested by another engineer by the name of Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman), who's own plan for a robotic police force under the name of ""MOOSE"" failed when Deon's robots were brought into the market, due to the enormous size and scope of his own creation. Deon is now working on creating a robot that has a consciousness and can think and feel like a real human being."
Chappie,"One day, Deon is kidnapped by a group of gangsters, Ninja (Ninja), Yolandi (Yolandi Visser), and Yankie (Jose Pablo Cantillo), who want the fictional ""remote"" for Deon's robots in order to shut down the robotic police force. When Deon informs them no such device exists, he gives them the prototype of the robot he's working on, equipped with a sound consciousness and human feelings. The gangsters agree to have Deon make infrequent trips back to their lair so he can train the robot, but the ultimate goal for the thieves is to use the robot to assist in heists and petty crime. The robot is named ""Chappie,"" and due to it actually having the ability to think and feel, it needs to be taught like a child the very basics of life. The film shows the four attempting to train the robot and the constant game of tug of war Deon plays with the three goons, which keeps pulling Chappie back and forth between a life of good and morality and a life of violence and destruction."
Chappie,"Now with three films under his belt not only establishing his affinity for science-fiction but his love for dystopian worlds that, he claims, take place only ""ten minutes in the future,"" director Neill Blomkamp has affirmed with ""District 9"" and now with ""Chappie"" (""Elysium,"" to this day, is unseen by me) that he can make a science-fiction film with commentary, humor, entertainment, and, most surprisingly of all, a soul. ""Chappie"" may be a hot mess of a film, throwing together silly comedy with grotesque violence, action, suspense, and futuristic drama, but it's a hot mess that shows other disastrous cinematic hot messes how it's done. Being that the film revolves around training a robot how to live, survive, and learn the basics of existence, it's only logical that a film about the sorts be filled with so many different genres, and writer/director Blomkamp (along with co-writer Terri Tatchell) handle almost everything effectively."
Chappie,"In addition to having an intriguing paradigm of humanity and technology coexisting when one is surpassing the other in terms of efficiency, Blomkamp also offers a real emotional core to the film's characters and character relationships, particularly that of Deon and Chappie. The two form such a strong, sensitive relationship with one another, despite being burdened by such a colossal danger with gang involvement, that the two carry out one of the most tender portrayals of a human's friendship with a humanoid that I have yet to see. While a devoted team of visual effects workers definitely have ""Chappie"" covered in a sense that it can be a visual spectacle, with the action scenes remaining clear and vibrant rather than muddled and incoherent most of the time, it's Blomkamp who surprises with his ability to evoke human sensibilities into a story I feared would lose it all in the shuffle of slambang action."
Chappie,"To digress just a bit, ""Chappie""'s marketing was something of a spectacle in itself. When trailers first surfaced, they didn't portray the film's ideas adequately, rushing to show glimpses of the more suspenseful moments in the film to hopefully gain the widest possible audience. The first poster, showing Chappie decked out in bling and surrounded by children's building blocks, looked almost as if this were a silly kids film. When the second trailer of ""Chappie"" premiered, which I had the pleasure of seeing at least a dozen times since the beginning of this year, seemed to hit the nail on the head, portraying the man vs. machine conflict in a much greater manner. Finally, ""Chappie"" was awarded a much-deserved R-rating from the MPAA, which helped finally solidify some good spirits about the film from me, seeing as it took its idea all the way and exercised its full ability to be creative and gritty."
Chappie,"The film is a winning blend of several genres, and should be look onto by those who wouldn't venture out to see such films of the like. Science-fiction fans will likely appreciate it, but, being someone who doesn't normally embrace these kinds of films with open arms and glowing praise, I feel the market who has long felt themselves rundown by the ubiquity of these kinds of films will see the merit and value in a film like this (the kind ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" will most likely bring to someone who has grown weary and fatigued by the onslaught of superhero films). Not only does ""Chappie"" provide some hope for original science-fiction in the near future, it also provides for diversity in multiplexes and a more attractiveness to those who feel outside of the loop on the majority of the particular releases of this genre."
Chappie,"I really liked this one. There's some obvious '80s influences here, from the criminals looking like something out of a Mad Max movie to the Short Circuit and Robocop elements. There's even a bit of a He-Man cartoon shown at one point. It's an intriguing and certainly entertaining movie, if not an overly original one. I think some critics are unhappy with the lack of pretentiousness that was present in Neill Blomkamp's previous work. Here the ""messages"" are more universal and less political. Some people only like their sci-fi if it carries with it an obvious metaphor for a topical social injustice. You can even find such metaphors here if you try but subtlety is not a zealot's cup of tea. Overall, I thought the script was good and I really liked the upbeat ending. Another nitpick I have about the modern critic is that they think the only good sci-fi story is one with a downer ending. The special effects are pretty amazing. The acting is solid all around. Dev Patel, Yo-Landi Vissir, Ninja, Jose Pablo Cantillo, and Sharlto Copley (voice & motion capture for Chappie) are all great. Hugh Jackman has a rare turn as the villain here and does a terrific job, even if I do hate the obligatory clichés his character is saddled with. That haircut, though..."
Chappie,"Maybe it's not for everybody. I have friends that haven't seen it yet that I'm fairly certain will bitch about it and pick it apart, like I see from many reviews on here. But that's their loss. I'm happy that Blomkamp tried to make a movie that's not dumb by any stretch but also isn't just aimed at the elitist film snob crowd or soapbox bloggers."
Chappie,"Upon seeing so much hype of Neill Blomkamp's latest project, Chappie, I had to see what his follow-up from past hits like District 9 and Elysium can do. When I did, the movie itself further left me puzzled, but kept me engaged in the action scenes. The idea of a robot who was originally programmed for serious community work with no sentient purposes seems to follow the trail left behind by past robot-based films like 'Wall-E,' 'I, Robot,' and notably 80s comedy 'Short Circuit.' Blomkamp film regular, Sharlto Copley certainly delivered such an amazing motion-capture performance as the innocent, yet gifted robot Chappie."
Chappie,"Comparing Chappie to Johnny 5 in terms of witty humor is something that has been done before, but the action sequences began to remind me of the intense, anarchic moments shown in Blomkamp's District 9, which is kind of the recurring themes in his previous projects. 'Slumdog Millionaire' star Dev Patel plays inventor Deon who reprograms one of the decommissioned robots (along with the assistance of two individuals of South African rap-rave group Die Antwoord) leading to Chappie seeing them as his parental figures as well as him focusing on the concepts of compassion, existentialism, and even nonconformity. It now proves that Chappie can be much more than just an obedient robot, but can actually express himself in ways the average human cannot comprehend."
Chappie,"The villain (played by Hugh Jackman) considers this sentient being a threat and plans to eradicate it in anyway possible, thus bringing Chappie and his human comrades to a full-scale rebellion against the oppressive tyrant and his forces."
Chappie,"I found the film to be enjoyable and sometimes laughable because it reminded me of the themes in not just the humor of 'Short Circuit,' but a near-similar scenario shown in 'I, Robot' as well in terms of consciousness being tested. The movie does indeed demote Jackman's hero reputation from past movies as the villain Vincent Moore since the archetypes of his character here feel too cliché. Sigourney Weaver's role as CEO Michelle Bradley feels unclear on what side does she really condone, but I felt her character development could've stretched more than what is shown on screen. Since the movie's setting takes place once again in the derelict, yet prosperous areas of Johannesburg, South Africa, I can already tell that it comes from the same vein as District 9. Since Blomkamp admitted that he would helm the next 'Alien' film, only time will tell of what he really thinks about the critical outcome of Chappie's success."
Chappie,"To conclude, whether they are misdeeds or not, Chappie is a likable robot who can pull off extraordinary things as any human (albeit even outlandish), maybe something better. The entire movie is nowhere near the equivalent of District 9 story-wise, but as Chappie quotes, ""I am consciousness. I am alive."" This further emphasizes that he is capable of thinking on his own and upon his understanding, it's human nature."
Chappie,What are you people smokin'?
Chappie,This was a writing disaster at every turn. I was stunned.
Chappie,"I'm not even a scientist on TV and I was aghast at the stupid science, even for science fiction. I'm absolutely okay with a giant costumed guy with a magical hammer. But this? No!"
Chappie,Why does our intrepid scientist need an actual robot to test his AI? He could easily do it from a computer. A box. Without legs and feet.
Chappie,"Then, in a perfect storm, the bad guys kidnap him and get their hands on the robot. Not only do they let the scientist go with full knowledge of their location, they have a time limit on getting money for their boss. What do they do? They turn in early for bed!"
Chappie,(And how does an American barrio gangster end-up in South Africa?)
Chappie,"Sure enough, the scientist comes back a couple times to the hideout!"
Chappie,"Let's not forget that the scientist easily sneaks out the back door of the factory a robot, along with the ONLY (and I mean ONLY) key to reprogramming the robots in the entire world. No time to make another?"
Chappie,Then the bulk of the movie hinges on the growth of the robot. He's suppose to be a child and we believe he's as cute as a kitten. Nevermind that the robot eventually downloads the entirety of the Internet into his data-banks (why not at the beginning of the film?) and is still the blithering idiot he was before.
Chappie,"And let us not forget Hugh Jackman who made a giant mistake on this one. His character is jealous that HIS version of the robot is not being used. As we found out from the finale, it was apparently a piece of crap that Sigourney Weaver's character should have known with a little quality check. And the guy pulls a gun in an office and then laughs it off. Nobody would have reported him?"
Chappie,Even that. This company's two prized project leaders are regulated to the cubicle jungle? (I enjoyed near the end when Sigourney Weaver escaped her office in the midst of bedlam WITH her purse and jacket.)
Chappie,"And also the robberies the bad guys do in order to get out from under their debt could have been done without the robot. Thus, no movie."
Chappie,So we go with the assumption that Chappie is now a sentient being with a consciousness that could not be simply transferred to another computer. Uhm...no.
Chappie,"In the interim, the two scumbag crooks that kidnapped Chappie (the guy) SUDDENLY turn into good guys at the end. Uhm...no. F'k 'em."
Chappie,"(I seem to remember that when this pile of c'p was marketed, it positioned itself as rebels resisting a oppressive government. I'm sure the producers were panicking as that has nothing to do with this garbage.)"
Chappie,And the shot and dying scientist has no other choice than being transferred to another robot. Not into another computer like I mentioned earlier? ONLY into a robot (essentially the same thing). And the same for Chappie.
Chappie,I've liked Bowkamp's movies before. This one is shockingly bad. It was directed well and looked good. But you know what? Didn't matter at all.
Chappie,"Well, all I can say is that this latest offering from Blomkamp pretty much puts him into the hall of great directors of the 21st century. Okay, while he may not be an Academy Award winning director, though I personally pay little to no attention to that Hollywood farce (and even then most of the films that I tend to like don't make it anywhere near that crowd, but that doesn't stop me enjoying them). However, when I first heard about this film from a friend I was under the impression that he was trying something a little different from his last two films. However as it turned, especially the poster which shows Chappie carrying a machine gun, I knew I was not going to be disappointed."
Chappie,"The movie is set a little into the future where Johannesburg is using robots to supplement their police force. However the creator of the robots is running a side project where he is attempting to create artificial intelligence, which he manages to do but lacks the equipment to test it. So he borrows one of the robots that has been marked for destruction and uploads the program. Unfortunately he is hi-jacked by some gangers who kidnap the robot (who pretty much has the mind of a baby) and attempt to turn him into a member of the gang."
Chappie,"While Chappie is not necessarily exploring ideas such as apartheid (as District 9 does) of privilege (as Elysium does), it does try to explore the idea of consciousness and whether our identity is tied to the body that we inhabit and whether it can be moved without changing the nature of who we are. It also explores the idea of artificial intelligence and whether such intelligence can create, in essence, a conscious sole."
Chappie,"There is another really interesting aspect to this film, and that is how various parties are all fighting over attempts to influence Chappie. One of the gangers, the self proclaimed leader, simply wants Chappie to assist him with a job, while others, such as the creator, want to see if they can make him more human by developing an appreciation of art and culture. Then we have his mother who nurtures him as if he were a child. Beyond that there are also other antagonists in the film, such as the jealous co-worker whose project as been sidelined because while it may be useful, in a sense it is pretty much overkill."
Chappie,"However, back to the idea of consciousness, and I guess the film also asks the question of what makes us human. Is our humanity defined by our appreciation of art and can this appreciation be programmed into a computer. Also, what is it that makes us who we are – are we merely the sum of our experiences, or does our identity go beyond that, and how much choice to we have in determining our identity. Chappie was created to see if he could develop as a human, but his development is interrupted with the kidnapping and he is then simply turned into another security droid, this time to act on the side of the criminals as opposed to the police. However it is also suggested that he can be influenced, such as when he is given those first orders, which results in him refusing to use guns. However, like a child, in many ways he begins as a blank slate and only develops his identity as he begins to move through and experience the world."
Chappie,"Why all the hate for this movie? I understand not liking something, but everyone seems to just TRASH it. Did I see the same movie? I saw an emotional film about innocence and loss. I REALLY don't understand. Sure, maybe the film didn't have the best dialogue or the best acting in the world, but it hit home for me. The VFX were phenomenal, Chappie is the best CGI motion capture I have seen in a long time, the 100% electronic musical score by Hans Zimmer was really unique and fresh, and it has a really great ending. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. If you like Blomkamp's previous films or are remotely interested, please watch it yourself. I think the critics are wrong on this one. I have been thinking for a while about why the reviews are so out there. First off, the trailers are AWFUL. The first to come out was this philosophical ""What does it mean to be human?"" kinda movie. The TV trailers were ""GUNS, EXPLOSIONS, ROBOTS!!!"" and it is neither. Think ""Little Miss Sunshine"" with a robot, that is a more accurate representation. Blomkamp's most underrated film."
Chappie,"Saw the great ratings and then was on the verge of bailing for the first time in years. So the first 'intelligent' robot hangs with dope dealing, violent thugs, wears gold chains, swaggers and finally when Chappie tells them he can not commit a crime they easily convince him that by not using his gun he can stop cars, toss the drivers a hundred feed in the air (which might kill them) and take their cars... all the while Chappies can not figure out, with all his 'intelligence' that he has become a major felon like the rest of the gang. Before this mess is over Chappie never saves even one innocent civilian but does manage to draw blood from an innocent armored car driver as he commits yet another major felony."
Chappie,"On the sci-fi part of the equation... we know Chappie's creator has invented a program that allows for the first 'thinking' robot. Suddenly, out of no where we're seeing the ability to transfer human's conscience to a robot. No explanation about how or way that is suddenly possible."
Chappie,"The IMDb description of the film is nonsensical. Chappie, is hunted when he is seen committing crime and not because he is trying to save humanity. The stars of this film and role model for Chappie are on the verge, several times, of executing Chappies creator. They are low life armed and dangerous dope dealing thugs."
Chappie,"Chappies amazing 'intelligence' finds him mindlessly following whomever is the latest person talking to him. Reasoning, morality, free will are out the window. Tell Chappie evil is good and he'll run with it."
Chappie,"Finally a gizmo, the size of a flash drive can put the city at peril. Yet, it seems easy as pie for employees to snatch it and do very dirty deeds. There is way more security on your local bank's safety deposit box. Nonsensical script and a cute named but felony loving, law breaking, dangerous robot. Yes, I was rooting.... for it to END!"
Chappie,"I liked District 9 and Elysium, so I was really looking forward to Chappie, especially for the special effects that I'd seen in those previous films. I felt like Chappie needed to be at least another hour longer to convey the director's message properly. There are way too many holes in the story to lead to such a thought-provoking ending. I'll say there was sufficient delivery on the special effects, but the story was not extensive enough. One - there's no explanation as to why ""Ninja"" and his mates owe some master criminal millions of dollars; two - one minute Chappie's being bullied by thugs and the next we're to expect they're loving foster parents; and three - why would transferring one's ""consciousness"" to another being also carry their voice and accent over? I expect a movie to suspend my beliefs for a couple of hours, but a story that flows well makes for $ better spent."
Chappie,"As may really happen soon(and this is set in the not too distant future, somewhere in time), and yet goes completely unexamined(and it's not the only compelling concept it fails to do much with), humanoid robots, Scouts(or, y'know, Homeland), largely replace regular police. One falls into the hands of a rather unlikable and one-note trio of criminals whose protagonist status is trying our patience, because of the former, not the latter. Chappie(Copley, sweet and charming, doing both well-integrated motion-capture and voice-work) is granted consciousness, and this innocent, childlike(yet rather powerful, able to kick through brick walls like it's nothing) being deals with different influences and goes through the range of human emotions with us finding ourselves touched, cheering him on, or scared for or of him."
Chappie,"Blomkamp delivers on both his good and bad tropes, and we end up with something in some ways better than Elysium, and it is thankfully less simplistic, mainstream and ridiculously one-sided, left-leaning(and I say that as a major Liberal). There are major problems with the characters. Moore(Jackman's mullet being as badass a presence as usual – yet here, we're afraid of who he'll hurt and how, instead of hoping he'll get there soon and get one of the really bad people that way), a former soldier who's Christian? Or is that a joke? Anyway, he's built a remote-controlled mech suit which is completely overkill for crime fighting(which may be satire of the recent militarization of such) which has been turned down. He has fun, and we vicariously enjoy the taste of the scenery. The other names are wasted, Weaver in particular. And that leaves us with earlier-mentioned obnoxious ones."
Chappie,"The action, whilst largely free of cool guns(don't get me wrong, the various bullet delivery systems on display, especially with how tricked out they are, are badass) is great. The ending and the opening are from different movies – to each other and to this one. Unpredictable and fast-paced to the point where it forgets its own plot threads the entire climax feels tailored and sacrifices scope in the name of focus, when a few rewrites could have addressed that much better. I do get a bad feeling that Neill is running out of ideas. With all the similarities between his three films, he almost should have pulled a Sin City and placed them all within the same universe."
Chappie,"There is a lot of brutal, violent and disturbing content, as well as a little sexuality and full frontal female nudity(because it can) in this. I recommend this to fans of the subgenre. 7/10"
Chappie,I was an hour into this film on Pay-Cable when my wife walked in.
Chappie,What are you watching? she asked.
Chappie,I told her.
Chappie,What is it about? she asked
Chappie,Watch it and see.
Chappie,So she did for about 5 minutes.
Chappie,Then she wanted to know WHY? I was watching it.
Chappie,That was a toughie
Chappie,Its got Jackman and Weaver. It is by a famous director. Its got strange accents. I can't find the remote
Chappie,"But, and I am being honest with you, the look in her eyes told me that she was having doubts about the man she married."
Chappie,So I tried a different tack.
Chappie,"I am watching because I cannot believe anyone would deliberately make a film this bad with such a stupid plot and stupid characters and an A-list cast. I mean, a character who was carjacked by killers actually tells them that he doesn't want a confrontation, this with a shotgun in his face, but he insists on coming back tomorrow to play with his robot."
Chappie,She accepted that excuse as reasonable.
Chappie,I am hoping you will too
Chappie,"It's a good thing Neill Blomkamp secured his next directing gig before his latest went into wide release; indeed, 'Chappie' marks yet another costly misstep that threatens to send his career the way of the Wachowskis. Its premise of an artificial intelligence becoming human is by now a familiar one, but rather than build on what its predecessors had to offer, this childish and noisy spectacle fails to develop any of its themes, be it the oft-repeated idea of consciousness or its social allegory of class divisions."
Chappie,"Set once again in Johannesburg in the near future, 'Chappie' opens in the same way as 'District 9' with mock news footage establishing how the police have commissioned an elite team of human-sized droids – called 'Scouts' – from a robotics firm known as Tetravaal to restore law and city and reduce the body count for the force as well. The 'Scouts' are the brainchild of an idealistic inventor called Deon (Dev Patel), whose creation is hailed by his company's CEO (Sigourney Weaver) to the consternation of a jealous colleague Vincent (Hugh Jackman). Unlike the 'Scouts', Vincent own invention dubbed the 'Moose' requires direct human control, and has understandably been sidelined as his company banks its future on greater deployment of the 'Scouts'. Their rivalry is supposed to set in motion a series of events that leads to our titular character taking on a much more heavily-armed 'Moose' in the overblown finale, but any sort of meaningful build-up between Deon and Vincent is cast aside in favour of a gangsta subplot that is frankly misplaced."
Chappie,"Celebrating his love for his homeland's rap-rave group Die Antwoord, Blomkamp has cast both members as low-life gangsters Ninja and Yo- Landi (played by the group's Ninja and Yo-Landi Visser), who in the opening sequence following the scene-setting newsreel are seen to have bungled a heist and now owe their boss Hippo $20 million. To procure the compensation owed, Yo-Landi comes up with the laughable notion of obtaining a remote control so that they can switch off the Scouts. The search for that 'remote' leads them to kidnap Deon, just as the latter has prepped one of the decommissioned Scouts – or 'Scout 22' as he calls it – for his experiment in synthetic consciousness. By simply uploading a data file he created, Deon turns that scout into a thinking and feeling robot who is also taken together with his inventor and earns the affection of Yo-Landi. It is Yo-Landi who gives him the name 'Chappie', and in turn, Chappie calls her 'Mommy' and Ninja 'Daddy'."
Chappie,"Almost the whole second act is dedicated to Chappie's learning as a sentient being, which is disturbing to say the least. On one hand, Mommy teaches him English, reads him bedtime stories and encourages him to go pursue his dreams. On the other, Daddy and his accomplice Amerika (Jose Pablo Cantillo) try to manipulate his fundamental mental constructs in order that he may assist them in their heist of an armoured vehicle. The fact that many of these scenes are played as comedy without any acknowledgment of its anarchic undertones only reinforces just how tone-deaf Blomkamp's movie is, so much so that Chappie's questioning of our human failings – expressed in his confusion why humans break promises and do bad things – rings hollow and even hypocritical."
Chappie,"There is no apartheid allegory here, but it is clear right from the onset that Blomkamp's sympathies still lie with the disfranchised in society. Though that posture may have worked in 'District 9', it feels shockingly misplaced here, in particular since their 'tutelage' leads only to violence, crime and death. It doesn't help that Chappie isn't an endearing character in his own right, coming across as a hyper-active chatterbox without nuance or restraint – and Chappie remains an unrelatable character from start to finish."
Chappie,"Despite his efforts at trying to get his audience to identify with his character's struggle to develop a mind and soul of his own – not just what his 'maker' programmes himself to be or what he has been taught to follow – Blomkamp fails to make good on an intriguing theme that several other filmmakers have explored to much, much better effect before or draw any poignancy out of it. Between Chappie's incessant chatter and Blomkamp's attempt to pack as much diffuse plot into the runtime, there is hardly any space given to explore the intellectual notions that the movie flirts with (but never indulges in any serious manner)."
Chappie,"The same idiocy unfortunately extends to its stock character archetypes. Patel's inventor is never given any motivation why he developed a consciousness for his androids in the first place. His rival played by Jackman is no more than a cartoonish villain, and even embarrassing for the A-list actor. Weaver continues a streak of playing the thankless supporting character, but the most ill-advised bit of scripting and casting has got to be the triumvirate of Ninja, Yo- Landi and Amerika/ Padillo, who are not only caricatures through and through but some of the more off-putting ones in recent memory. Sharlto Copley does a capable motion-capture for Chappie, but that work is sadly overshadowed by a character that could absolutely do with an overhaul."
Chappie,"Ditto for the whole picture in fact, which recycles themes from much better genre equivalents and gives them a South African underbelly spin that frankly doesn't work. Blomkamp's flair for staging a propulsive picture (with some help from an equally intrusive score from Hans Zimmer) is still intact, and so is his verve, but 'Chappie' is hyper-frenetic, over-plotted and yet under-developed at the same time. It is not even 'Elysium', which Blomkamp has in recent weeks admitted that he 'f**ked up'. We only wonder what he is going to say about 'Chappie' when he starts doing his rounds for the next 'Alien' movie."
Chappie,"This movie has so many holes that I cannot even cover them all. I love how movie makers think of Artificial Intelligence as Artificial Feeling. It was really ridiculous that the robot immediately started acting like a child as soon as it had AI. A machine will act like a child only if it's programmed to behave like one. Not just by giving it self awareness. It was also stupid that the movie tried to make heroes out of the stupid vicious criminals. And implanting the consciousness to new body to achieve immortality, this has been used in the movie The 6th day with Arnold Schwartzenegger. Implant memory to new cloned body to live forever. But is this real immortality? If your body die as soon as you transfer your consciousness, it may seem like immortality but what if your body doesn't die? And this clone with your memory is standing in front of you. Is that clone really you? It's just a copy. Overall, this movie tries to deal with few philosophical topics but at very elementary level. And just copied elements from many other movies that are far more interesting and just made it worse. Actings were horrible too."
Chappie,"I went into Chappie as a huge fan of the gritty action and social commentary of District 9. I expected that this would be more of the same. Both are still present, but surprisingly, with laughs."
Chappie,"This is one of the more entertaining movies from every angle that I've seen in awhile. I described it as I left as funny, sad, uplifting, dark, light, silly, and tense."
Chappie,"The center of the story is Chappie. He is a hero you want to shelter, even though you want him to learn. But even as you love his curiosity, you fear his naiveté. He is the most complex character, and gives a fascinating paradigm into how children must receive and process human society and contradiction. There are some inconsistencies in Chappie's character (is he already programmed to raise his voice if he's scared, or did he learn that?), but he still succeeds as a dynamic, independent being."
Chappie,"Yes, the humans characters are flat. They are merely roles. The Maker. The Villain. Mommy and Daddy. The friend. But as Chappie begins to learn, you see why they have to be flat. They are trying to exert influence on a (robotic) child. Therefore, they must simplify their own motivations and desires into the most basic explanations possible for Chappie to understand. This leads to hilarious imitation and thought-provoking perspectives."
Chappie,"Chappie's curiosity was once ours. Chappie's confusion was once ours. Watching Chappie is like watching a sped-up version of childhood social and moral development, with all of the Hollywood tension, explosions, and naughty words to keep you interested, too. There are parts to laugh at because it's funny, parts to laugh at because the costuming and set design is ridiculous, but you still end up thinking seriously the whole time."
Chappie,Give it a chance. You might love it. I did.
Chappie,"A few years ago; Neill Blomkamp; from South Africa, came up with a strange and quite original sci-fi movie called ""District 9""; filmed in the worst part of Johannesburg; with had an open ending that left everybody wanting for more. The movie had a well deserved success; however Blomkamp follow up was ""Elysium""; a Hollywood expensive (and quite controlled) production with big stars; that did not reach the greatness of his previous work. Now; the guy bring us a cheaper (but far less Hollywood controlled) sci-fi tale; filmed again in Johannesburg dumps; that will work every possible emotion you can have with an open but quite strange ending. Dev Patel (a great actor that really deserves more work) is Deon; an engineer working for a public corporation who has developed a droid used to help the police forces. The droids are a selling very good; but Deon wants to implement Artificial Intelligence in the droids. Something his boss do not allow; so he steals a damaged but partially operational droid to make an experiment. However, three tugs (Ninja, Yolandi and Jose Pablo Cantilo ) kidnap him and the droid. When Deon install the AI the droid starts acting like a child so Yolandi; a drug addict with failed maternal desires; name him Chappie and start treating as a kid while Ninja tries to use it for a robbery. Deon is released; but he refuse to leave because he wants to follow up Chappie's building conscience. There is also another engineer; Vincent (Hugh Jackman in an unexpected bad / nuts guy role) envious of Deon success; discover the new Intelligent droid and tries to sabotage everything creating a total chaos. The movie goes from a very violent start to tender moments (Chappie is adorable and innocent) to dramatic situations (Ninja refuse to consider himself a father), to comedy (Chappie becomes a gang member) to more violent and sometimes quite gory situations to a dramatic, tense and even more violent third act and finally to a poetic ending (depending your religion beliefs). There is no boring moment and laughs or suspense grow easily and unexpected."
Chappie,In brief; if Chappie catch you emotional handle; it will keep you tied up until the very end. If you are a cold and insensitive person you will notice only the violence and perhaps part of the humor; if you are a person of certain faith; you will probably hated it but in any case is a great movie for everybody but not for kids.
Chappie,I believe this movie only solidifies my concrete statement that 21st century is an age of pointless cinema.
Chappie,"Most of the plot in Chappie either fails to follow common human logic, or completely breaks it. This is a modern trend of over- dramatizing the events by making ""shit happen"" in the literal meaning of this phrase."
Chappie,"It all starts in a not-too distant future with an international corporation, based in SAR, which solved the problem of rising crime wave by introducing almost all-robotic police force."
Chappie,Then few things just happen:
Chappie,"They bust the doctor, while he was driving a van with a stolen robot. After successful installation of new software they get a semi-intelligent gansta-ninja robot filled with curiosity, deep understanding of neural interfaces and human consciousness, but lacking the basic knowledge of trauma, pain and death (even with internet connection)."
Chappie,"The end result: all robots are broken, everyone is dead. After lots of shooting and the final boss battle Chappie revives the doctor and his mama as robots. Credits start rolling, so are my strained eyes..."
Chappie,Gave it 3/10 for visuals. Everything else sucks. All the aspects of the movie that fans claim to be unique and innovative have been meticulously copied from many other(even recent) sci-fi titles with no sign of shame or remorse.
Chappie,"Fans of Neil Blomkamp rejoice, another tale has arisen to slap us in the face about the pessimistic place the world is. This time his vision is in the form of a robot, who obtains artificial intelligence that will, as always, revolutionize the world. While we all know the usual consequences of this motion, you never know what twists Blomkamp's movies will have. Thus for this movie called Chappie, the trailers may have you"
Chappie,"Expect: A dark, cynical tale about how humans suck, action, and something weird will happen."
Chappie,What you get:
Chappie,"Blomkamp has an obsession with darker films, as seen in District 9 and Elysium. Chappie from the start brings out that darkness, plopping us in the middle of civil unrest and death as war breaks out between thugs and the robotic police force. For nearly two hours, this darkness continues to grow as we are subjugated to heavy dialog that begins to question the roles and responsibilities of humans. Why is this dark you ask? Because Blomkamp chooses to address the negative side of things, often emphasizing the less attractive qualities of greed, anger, jealousy, and arrogance to a fault. We get it humans suck, how many times do you have to deliver the same message? His efforts to further analyze the flaws of humanity are further exaggerated by panoramic shots of shacks and grime filled buildings, as well as curse laden dialog. I indeed did feel some of the message, but the movie went too far on some of the characters that I grew annoyed or laughed at the ridiculous direction the film took. Some of the scenes were a bit too much for me at times, especially the bouts of torture or slander that Chappie, the one ray of hope in this movie, had to endure. His innocence was supposed to offset the darkness, but Blomkamp and crew quickly washed that away and left me more depressed than anything."
Chappie,"I think the darkness was further enhanced by the impressive editing the team did on the movie. In particular Chappie was animated beautifully, his detail and movements flowing without flaw. The robot is human all on his own, and shows the gullible side of our selves, in particular when we are children aiming to please. Throw in the gut wrenching orchestra work and the sadness and dismay of the plot continues to unfold and leave you a little morbid at being humans. His message is clear we need to take action, but come on a little more happiness could have gone a long way."
Chappie,"Action wise the movie follows the same formula his previous installments have. The movie starts out with pedal to the medal shootout excitement to help establish how Chappie comes to be. However the adrenaline quickly ebbs as the ethical discussions begin and we are left to sit through about an hour and half of dialogue before the next bout of fighting begins. The end game is not quite as exhilarating though, the epic shoot out turning more bloodbath and bang as our cast of characters are tortured. Again darkness seems to be the calling of this tale, and the action is not spared of the honed, ruthless edge of blood and death. The scenes are also melodramatic as well, the actors falling in cascades of slow motion screaming and running. I wasn't impressed with the promise the trailers held, but again you never know with Blomkamp."
Chappie,"As for the weird factor well the entire movie is pretty much weird. The artificial intelligence angle has been played a bunch of times, but this one is a bit weird in terms of Chappie thinking the humans are its parents. Another twist was discussing the nature of consciousness and its involvement in making us human. You'll find this is centered once again around death, and is relayed to what a soul is. Such concepts may be a little too much for some audience members, and I admit leads to some very ""interesting"" albeit philosophical paths. You will find that the ending is very similar to some other big blockbuster plots. I can say that the ending provides some light at the end of the dark tunnel, but it also leaves it on an ambiguous note as well, most likely to open for another potential sequel."
Chappie,"I can say Chappie is a very well produced movie, with fantastic special effects, animation, and a reassessment of humanity. Yet the cynical approach to this movie left me depressed, which when combined with the morbid dialog bored me at times. This film is definitely an artistic, with much symbology and passion captured on screen, but I still look for more entertainment in my movies. So who can I recommend this movie to? I will definitely recommend this film to fans of District 9 and Elysium, as well as those who like a dark approach to their science fiction movies. In addition if you like having a philosophical blow out during a movie, again I recommend this. Otherwise, skip this film and wait for next weekend's releases as they hold more promise."
Chappie,My scores for this movie are:
Chappie,Action/Sci-Fi/Thriller: 7.0 Overall: 6.5
Paddington,"A geographic explorer goes to the darkest Peru and encounters two ingenious bears. He names them Pastuzo and Lucy wondering what will come of them. They learn English, admire London and love marmalade. Many years later, they are joined by their young nephew. After a storm devastates their home, the young bear goes to London with Aunt Lucy promising a welcoming place. Instead he is alone and only taken in by Mary Brown (Sally Hawkins) although her husband Henry (Hugh Bonneville) is very risk-adverse. She names him Paddington after the train station. There is also Millicent (Nicole Kidman) who wants to stuff the bear."
Paddington,This honors the children series with a bear that is charming and delightful. It's a lot fun comedy without too many pop culture references. That gives it a timeless quality. The family is terrific and Nicole Kidman is interesting as the villain with a real story of her own. This is a perfect little family film.
Paddington,"I confess that I was never taken with the marketing for ""Paddington"". MOstly, the CG in the bear himself. But that tends to be absorbed into the movie's overall sweetness and playful visual style. At the heart of this is a wholesome message about human decency and belonging, and it's populated with likable Brits (Hugh Bonneville, in particular). Some good laughs, too; like seeing a trying to figure out a toothbrush or negotiate scotch tape."
Paddington,"It's a good-natured movie, and what makes it a cut (or two or three) above modern family fare is that there's very little in the way of pop culture references and hipness."
Paddington,Just warmth.
Paddington,7/10
Paddington,"One of the things I resent the most in modern children's film and stories and in modern animation is that they can be visually enthralling but have not magic, no soul or no charm. I also dislike the fact that too many fables and old-books stories are brought to the screen with no soul and respect for the original characters and stories."
Paddington,"To my delight, this is not Paddington's case."
Paddington,"Paddington is a brilliant exception to the dullness, soulless bunch of animated movies for kids out there. This is so mostly so because the original story is there, Paddington and the the Brown's family's souls and personalities are there, they feel modern and contemporary, but not too far removed from the original. Pablo Grillo's animation is fantastic per se, but there are many amazing animators out there; what sets this film animation apart is the magic infused into it, so we come to see Paddington as Paddington, not as a puppet, not as a CGI character, not as a fictional. Paddington feels real in this movie, as real as any of the actors."
Paddington,"The ambiance of the film is whimsical, it mixes elements that are very modern but also capturing a bit of the old London where the original story is set. The film has a great tempo, is full of fancy and fun, innocence and naughtiness, havoc and tenderness, action and stillness, happiness and sadness, adventure, laughter and family love."
Paddington,"The cast in this film is great, per se, but that not always guarantees a good movie in the end. However, all the actors are great and believable in this film. I especially liked Nicole Kidman in her evil sassy ruthless manipulative and sweet villain role."
Paddington,"The music is also fantastic with plenty of Latin rhythms throughout the film. Paddington is Peruvian, after all."
Paddington,"Paddington is not only a very sweet, fun an enjoyable film. It also has a great message about accepting those who are different and welcoming those who need of our care because have nowhere to go; two things that we should be reminded of in these troubled times when refugees are sometimes treated as an ""it"" not as Paddington. There should be more Brown families in the world."
Paddington,"I was expecting another dumb movie for kids. To my delight, Paddington is a a tender fun-filled magical film that made me feel a kid again."
Paddington,"Usually, I'm not a very nostalgic person and I'm certainly not a person who watches Dinsey films as an adult. However, Michael Bond's Paddington has always fascinated me since my early childhood. The idea of an innoent bear from darkest Peru integrating into British society has intrigued me much. The novels have a lot of creativity and soul as they offer beautiful life experiences and valuable morals. Since I have always loved animals, it wasn't a surprise that I was always rooting for the sympathetic young bear."
Paddington,"In many cases, live-action or CGI animated movies fail to capture the essence of the novels they were inspired by. To my very positive surprise, this is an entirely different thing for this particular movie. The animated bear looks splendid and the actresses and actors around him do a very credible job, making us believe that the young bear is truly around them. Paddington doesn't look out of place in contemporary London and actively interacts with his diversified surroundings."
Paddington,"The story is nicely crafted as well. It tells us the sad yet hopeful background story of the charming young bear in a concise way. We then explore how the bear finds a new home, new friends and new experiences in London. There are many humorous scenes that put a constant smile upon your face such as Paddington taking a bath in a very chaotic way. Despite creating so much chaos, the young bear changes people around him in a very positive way. On the other side, the movie also has a dramatic side as Paddington is trying to find out more about his origins and comes across a pitiless taxidermist who stuffs exotic animals. The mixture of light-hearted comedy, gripping drama and surprisingly humane life lessons from a young bear is absolutely splendid."
Paddington,"As someone who isn't nostalgic, I was truly moved by this film and enjoyed it from start to finish. The makers of this movie have managed to recapture the magic of the novels and bring them onto screen. Paddington is a very rewarding experience for younger and older viewers. If you aren't familiar with Paddington at all, you have missed out on something and discovering this fascinating franchise will change your mind about children's literature. In times, when cinemas are flooded with gruesome Battle Royale copies, it's refreshing to go back to such a classic franchise with a pure message. Watching this movie will make you feel like an innocent child again. Bears are the better human beings."
Paddington,"I have to state this before continuing with this review, prior to seeing this I was very reluctant and hesitant as to what I was due to view. After growing up hearing the stories and watching the animated tales of Paddington Bear, I was unsure as to whether a CGI-heavy live- action tale could really establish a story that portrays the bear in all his charm, well my predictions were woefully inaccurate. 'Paddington' is a very well-executed adaptation of the titular bear for a 21st century audience. From the producers of Harry Potter, 'Paddington' delivers a family-friendly and charming atmosphere whilst conveying an endearing and gloriously comedic tale about a bear and his adventures in London. One of the late and great films of the year, Paul King's irresistibly warm story creates a sense of nostalgia whilst boasting a quintessentially British feel and pitch-perfect humour that can be enjoyed by people of all ages."
Paddington,"""I LIKE THE BEAR,"" a little girl exclaimed behind me during the first few minutes of Paddington. The delighted reaction took me by surprise, and then it turned into a reminder. The farther I drift away from childhood, the longer I avoid interacting with elementary-aged children, there is a tendency to forget that there is such a thing as kids movies and family movies. I saw The LEGO Movie with my dad, true, but even then, it felt like I was watching a slightly sanitized version of The Simpsons instead of a reprehensible Pixar knockoff."
Paddington,"These days, family movies try as hard as they can to appeal to the kiddos and their parents; maybe executives know how excruciating it can be to sit through a particularly painful foray into baby-talk and recycled jokes. Though it isn't my personal favorite genre, it is undeniable that family films please more routinely than any other category in film. So much emphasis is put onto each project that it's rare to find a stinker among the handful."
Paddington,"But most children's films are only good, entertaining for the time being but not packed with enough quality to have an impact for more than a few months. Imagine my surprise when Paddington went from 0 to 60, straight into my cynical heart. Paddington is far too marvelous to throw around the effective cliché that it has something for the kids and something for the adults; like Babe, The Muppets, and yes, even Frozen, it transcends our prejudiced assumptions and takes us inside a fairy tale where anything can happen. It doesn't matter what age we are; it is as if you could throw dust into the air, only to find it fall in a golden flurry. Paddington shouldn't work, but it does. It does so well, in fact, that I can say with full confidence that it is one of the best genre films of the decade."
Paddington,"Paddington the Bear is already a beloved literary figure, of course, but when we first meet him in his own star vehicle, it is as though he is new again. As the film begins, we find him living in Darkest, Peru with his aunt and uncle (Imelda Staunton and Michael Gambon), both of whom are marmalade obsessed and intelligent enough to speak in cultured British accents. The film explains this noteworthy phenomenon: decades earlier, an explorer arrived in Peru, and, smitten with the bears otherworldly craftiness, taught them how to act as if they were civilized human beings."
Paddington,"After tragedy strikes, Paddington's aunt decides that it would be best if her nephew went to find a home in London. When he arrives at a train station, most disregard his exuberant politeness, but not Mrs. Brown (Sally Hawkins). Her family looks at him with differing levels of judgment, especially her husband (Hugh Bonneville), but the Brown's pity him, eventually deciding to take him in."
Paddington,"Paddington may have inimitable manners, but he surely isn't gifted when it comes to gracefulness (in a hilariously mounted comedic sequence, Paddington discovers the joys of the family bathroom, only to flood the entire house). Most would give him up, but with his considerable charm to make up for his klutziness, he even wins over Mr. Brown. But just as things begin to look up into storybook heaven, Millicent Clyde (a scene- stealing Nicole Kidman) enters the scene, a blood-thirsty taxidermist who wants nothing more than to stuff Paddington for her latest exhibit."
Paddington,"With its candy-colored imagery and bouncy humor, Paddington is impossible to resist, a feature that really and truly makes you relive the glorious innocence of childhood. Voiced by the genial Ben Whishaw, Paddington is a fluffy friend for the ages, more cuddly and comical than Despicable Me's famed Minions. The CGI used to flesh him out is so convincing that every single strand of fur sticks out with remarkable detail; there were times I forgot that Paddington is an outright miracle of animation, not a real-life talent I could meet on the red carpet."
Paddington,"There you have it. Paddington doesn't need an analysis, nor does it need a critic to highlight how much of a wonder it is. It is an unusually magical and unusually well-crafted family movie that needs to be watched immediately. Take you mom, take your dad, take your sister, take your brother — take anybody. Because, like the little girl who sat behind me during its extraordinary 95 minutes, I like the bear."

Paddington,"When his home in Darkest Peru is destroyed, a young bear travels to London in order to find a new home. He's helped by a couple with two kids, which share different opinions regarding the new troublemaker which ""landed"" in their home. Although helping him find a proper home, the Browns start to attach to the newcomer but his negligent way of life and an evil hunter from a local history museum tend to interfere in their relationship, for better or worse."
Paddington,"We're presented with the amusing and entertaining adventures of this strange bear which comes to a big city in search of a new life, but ends up in a lot of trouble, more or less due to his actions. It's a movie which doesn't have an extraordinary plot, but it's enough to keep you interested while making you laugh with almost everything the cute bear does. By the way, the CGI is top notch, and together with the actors' performance, create a good movie for everybody to enjoy. As downsides, it tends to exaggerate in many scenes, while being very simplistic when speaking about the ""evil"" part which hunts Paddington."
Paddington,"Still, it manages to create a very enjoyable atmosphere which makes this movie a very good watch, especially during winter holidays."
Paddington,"Was not expecting to enjoy it as much as I did, to be honest, after seeing the trailer which gave off the vibe that it was going to be another live-action/CGI outing with a weak script, a predictable story, cheap gags and characters we don't care about. After seeing the film, Paddington had none of those things and the trailer really did not do it justice, it may not entirely have the essence of the stories and TV series but it modernises the setting etc. very cleverly and stands very well on its own terms."
Paddington,"Paddington looks great, with lots of vibrant colour in the sets(the forest in the prologue is beautiful as well) and with photography that's not haphazard or sloppy. Paddington himself is brilliantly animated and the complete opposite of cheap. The music has its playful-in the humour/slap-stick- and soothing)in the emotional parts) moments, while the script is a sheer delight with deliciously witty dialogue that children and adults alike will understand and enjoy. The story is also a winner, the comedy scenes are just hilarious and very well-timed, something that will absolutely delight children, and the adult jokes are equally sly with inspired references(in a visual way) to the likes of Wes Anderson. Paddington also has a lot of heart and warmth, there are some emotional moments and they were very touchingly done without being cloying, and there is even a bit of suspense thrown in without being too dark or out of place."
Paddington,"In Paddington, I found myself really engaging with the characters even Mr Brown. The strongest being Paddington who is incredibly endearing, it's almost impossible not to love him. Ben Wishaw also voices him absolutely beautifully, bringing a calm, youthful quality to it. Hugh Bonneville is appropriately uptight and stern while also bringing humour and warmth to Mr Brown. Sally Hawkins is compassionate, the children are good and Nicole Kidman is both amusing and menacing(wasn't crazy about the wig though. Jim Broadbent and Julie Walters play their roles expertly, Walters especially is a hoot as Mrs Bird, while Imelda Staunton and Michael Gambon while limited in appearance bring heart to their roles. My only complaint that Mr Curry should have had more screen time and the film could have stayed truer to the character in the stories and series. Peter Capaldi does a good job, but the character and his acrimonious relationship with Paddington was one of the best things of the series and Mr Curry instead seemed more of a plot device, with the relationship between them barely explored."
Paddington,"To conclude, a delightful family film with something for everyone. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
Paddington,"Paddington, the beloved Michael Bond bear known by generations in children's books, made his welcome CGI live action debut with this delightfully spirited hoot, hopping on a boat hidden after leaving ""darkest Peru"" for London after an explorer visited him and his aunt/uncle in the jungle, making quite an impression on them. Once in London he encounters risk analyst and his family who aren't as much astounded by a talking bear as concerned about his need of a refuge. Meanwhile a taxidermist (Nicole Kidman) eyes Paddington for her natural museum. While the attention to detail and quirky direction warrant comparison to Wes Anderson, the treat of this film is how London is used as an aesthetic backdrop for Paddington's adventures. And the CGI work for the bear and the marvelous voicework of Ben Whishaw enhance the whole experience. Marmalade is ever present, as is the explorer's hat with the sandwich Paddington never gets to eat because of those pesky pigeons. Paddington's bond with the Browns (Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins, Madeleine Harris, and Samuel Joslin) despite unfortunately flooding from a bathroom mishap and a fire in their kitchen caused by Kidman trying to snatch him tightens as the bear wins their hearts. Sweet tone never wavers despite Kidman's dark character, cleverly tied to the explorer who met Paddington's family years ago. The subway scenes (including a dazzler involving Paddington chasing down a pickpocket) are exciting, visually arresting, and amusing, especially an escalator which Paddington is confounded by. The antiquities shop, with Jim Broadbent and that amazing train inside, is a big wow. Imelda Staunton and Michael Gambon offer fun voicework as Paddington's aunt and uncle, besieged in the jungle by an earthquake. Julie Walters is a treat as eccentric housekeeper for the Browns who offers her opinions from time to time and comes in handy when the family must rescue Paddington from Kidman. Peter Capaldi as the nosy next door neighbor who sides with Kidman to rid the apartments of the bear steals the film when he is on screen. The inventive set pieces involving the Smiths residence inescapably call to mind Anderson's oeuvre but are all the same striking. Recommended family film for the holidays."
Paddington,"There's plenty to be cynical about where Paddington is concerned. The first feature film about the iconic bear - red hat, blue coat, suitcase in hand - was first announced in 2007, and went through a gestation period that's extraordinarily long even for a heavily animated film. The trailer's (literal) toilet humour seemed to confirm that it was pitched firmly at kids. And last, but certainly not least, the cast experienced a shake-up of fairly seismic proportions when Colin Firth announced in July that - with the unanimous consent of all concerned - he would no longer be voicing Paddington. All signs pointed towards a disaster of a movie, one stitched together to cash in on rather than celebrate the phenomenon of Paddington, a little bear who has lived in books, TV series and cuddly merchandise around the world."
Paddington,"It's a flat-out joy to discover, then, that Paddington is very far from a disaster. Indeed, it's an unmitigated delight of a family film. Of course, ""family films"" don't really cater to everyone in the family a lot of the time - the phrase is a euphemism applied to movies that adults must put up with or suffer through for the sake of entertaining their children. But Paul King's Paddington, based on the beloved books by Michael Bond, really does have something for everyone and is, incidentally, an utterly lovely movie about families to boot. The young will be bowled over by the adorable bear who tumbles through London and into the hearts of his adopted family. The young at heart -and even a few older, crankier people - will find much to enjoy in the film's cheerfully subversive script."
Paddington,"Our journey begins in Darkest Peru, where a young bear (voiced with pitch-perfect charm by Whishaw) lives happily with his Aunt Lucy (Staunton) and Uncle Pastuzo (Gambon). He inherits from them a healthy love for marmalade and London, as well as a floppy, red felt hat left behind decades ago by English explorer Montgomery Clyde (Downie). When an earthquake destroys their idyllic home, Aunt Lucy urges her nephew to strike out to London. Many jars of marmalade later, he finds himself in the iconic train station that gives him his name. He meets the Brown family: risk- averse Henry (Bonneville), dreamy Mary (Hawkins) and their children, Judy (Harris) and Jonathan (Joslin). With Henry insisting that Paddington can only stay while he looks for a more permanent home, the bear begins investigations in London - unaware that Millicent, an obsessive, possibly crazy taxidermist (Kidman), has very specific reasons for wanting him to visit her museum."
Paddington,"Strictly speaking, there isn't anything all that new or original about Paddington. We've seen the trope many times before - in trying to find a new home, a misfit changes the hearts and minds of the people who will eventually become his family. The narrative of the film is also little more than a patchwork of wacky incidents and hijinks: Paddington floods the bathroom while trying to come to terms with the ""facilities""; Paddington apprehends a criminal through sheer good luck and his incredibly honest nature; Paddington and Henry infiltrate the top-secret Geographers' Guild to hunt down Mr. Clyde."
Paddington,"And yet, King has crafted something quite charming and magical around the bare bones of his story. The film practically radiates love for the sweet-tempered, unfailingly polite bear at its heart. A life-long fan of the ursine hero, King peppers his script with smart references to Bond's books, from Paddington's trademark 'hard stare', used to embarrass people into behaving better, through to the meddling interference of nosy, thrifty neighbour Mr. Curry (Capaldi). He's also updated and deepened the story to give the elder Browns their own emotional arc: Mary's determination to open her heart and home to a stranger is what eventually leads Henry to getting back in touch with his wilder, more fun-loving side. The film also looks quite spectacular, whether Paddington is surfing down a flight of stairs in a bathtub or we're allowed a dollhouse glimpse at the Brown family as they go about their lives."
Paddington,"Most importantly, King infuses the entire film with a practically joyous strain of comedy and wit. Pratfalls and sight gags are accompanied by deliciously silly allusions to William Shakespeare and Mission Impossible. Even the film's supporting characters get their own hefty share of comedy, whether it's housekeeper Mrs Bird (Walters) distracting a security guard by means of a booze throwdown or Mr. Curry falling instantly for Millicent to a smooth burst of Lionel Richie. Millicent herself is an inspired creation. Prowling through the film, togged out in figure-hugging snakeskin and wielding scalpels, she brings to mind and subverts the icy-cool blonde archetype most beloved of Alfred Hitchcock."
Paddington,"The sharp script and stunning visuals would mean little without a cast wholly committed to their roles, and King has struck gold with his offbeat casting choices. Bonneville, a veteran of Downton Abbey, has no problem playing Henry's constant anxiety over his children, but also gleefully flings propriety to the winds as he slips into tunic and apron for a spot of howlingly funny undercover business. Hawkins lends Mary - the loving, tender heart of the household and Paddington's biggest champion - a soulful gravitas. Great as they are, however, the MVP here is Kidman. Her fantastically manic performance as Millicent reminds us why it's a damn shame that she hasn't been in a comedy for years - she's so cheerfully unhinged in the film that she steals pretty much every scene she's in."
Paddington,"It doesn't matter whether you're a fan of Bond's books, someone who only knows Paddington as a cuddly soft toy, or a neophyte who has never heard of this walking, talking, marmalade-loving bear. Paddington is a big, warm bear hug of a film, one that will enchant children and tickle adults, even as it grabs just about everyone by the heart with its charm and humour."
Paddington,"Based on the works of author Michael Bond, ""Paddington"" tells the story of a talking bear (Ben Whishaw) from ""darkest"" Peru who stows away on a cargo ship to start a new life for himself in London. Once there, he becomes involved with a family named Brown (Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins, Madeleine Harris, Samuel Joslin), who take him into their home on a temporary basis, and a villainous taxidermist (Nicole Kidman) intent on literally ""stuffing"" the bear for an exhibit in a natural history museum."
Paddington,"Written by Paul King and Hamish McColl and directed by King, ""Paddington"" is a seamless blend of live action and animation, cheery in tone and beautiful to look at, thanks to the highly stylized art direction and production design that adorn the film. The humor ranges from the brittle to the overly broad (Bonneville dressed as an old scrubwoman sounds a discordant note in an otherwise fairly sophisticated screenplay). The movie also includes some subtle little homages to ""My Fair Lady,"" ""Home Alone,"" ""Mission Impossible"" and, most notably, Walt Disney's ""Mary Poppins."""
Paddington,"Fast-paced, well acted, and with warmth and charm to spare, ""Paddington"" is a whimsical treat that should appeal almost as much to oldsters as it does to youngsters."
Paddington,"Real-life link: Just for the record, I have never experienced that kind of snow in London and I have lived here for a very long time. So that is way beyond reality (tho I wish it will someday snow like that). However, one very true fact about London is that indeed everyone is different and because of that everyone can fit in and feel like home. The magic of London I guess. What the movie emphasised on was dealing with accepting that you are different and feeling comfortable with it. Sad however, to see that Paddington was only able to do that when the Browns did suggesting that the only way to be comfortable with who you are, is of those around you are. It is in many cases true but it shouldn't be and movie developed around this suggestion are indeed not helping to change that."
Paddington,"The movie is very hear-warming. Warm family atmosphere and a lot of scenes that made me laugh out loud (literally). Acting is great as well, with Hugh Bonneville being amazing as always. And the editing is also not a usual one which makes the movie great. London is also nicely portrayed and it was a pleasure to see some very familiar places in the movie. To conclude, I would definitely recommend this to everyone (yes, including adults)."
Paddington,"Paddington works well. All the great ingredients of a good film. A compelling story. Will Paddington find a home in a new environment? The fish out of water humour of Paddington's adventure works well. The chain reaction silly event comedy done in a silly British way! Likable characters Paddington, the family and the villain were well casted. We can relate with the story arch of each character. The comic,dramatic, and evil characters all deliver strong performances. The director knows when to create drama, empathy, and comedy with the right timing. Paddington (the character and movie) is silly and even more silly. A good escape for adults as well as children. The effects where not too C G Iish 7 out of 10 stars."
Paddington,"I saw ""Paddington"" with my granddaughter (almost four) and it's hard to be sure who enjoyed it most since this is such an utterly charming and entertaining movie."
Paddington,"Visually it is a delightful CGI representation of the eponymous bear (politely voiced by Ben Wishaw) and deploys some neat cinematic devices; script-wise it combines humour, word play, and sharp allusions to the plight of the immigrant; while acting- wise we have a slew of marvellous British performers including Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins and Julie Walters as the adults in Paddington's new family and Nicole Kidman who has other plans for our furry friend."
Paddington,"In a movie full of delights, the bathroom scene is a classic. A sequel or even a series is inevitable and would be most welcome."
Paddington,"This is what happens when the best of all the different departments of British filmmaking come together. From the cast, the script, the animation and everyone else involved with this project - this film (and the sequel to it) come together to create a flawless story for all ages."
Paddington,Both this and the sequel are closely related and both must have been made either at the same time or with each other in mind.
Paddington,"Like Disney's 'Peter Pan', the story is mostly about the kids and the titular character... and both give a generous portion of the narrative to the characters of the parents. There are other parallels, too."
Paddington,The voice of Ben Whishaw as Paddington is perfect and it's eerily similar to the sound of a softer Terence Stamp. At times you'd swear these two must have been born in the same room!
Paddington,"Hugh Bonneville is sublime as the harried father who takes parenthood very seriously, although not always in a direction his wife and kids approve of. (Lots of teens will relate to that!)"
Paddington,"Sally Hawkins is simply brilliant as the wife who hasn't quite left her decadent '60s' years behind her... and who delivers the shortest lines ('Oooh, laminated!' & 'Crikey!') with phenomenal execution."
Paddington,"Lots of slapstick for the kids and plenty of Easter eggs for the bigger kids, too."
Paddington,"If you're a fan of the 'Richard Curtis' school of pathos, comedy, and storytelling, you'll love this."
Paddington,"A small bear from Peru arrives in London and is given shelter and the name Paddington by the Brown family (somewhat against the wishes of Mr Brown). Mishaps follow, not least because someone wishes to add Paddington to a collection of stuffed animals."
Paddington,"Paddington has been a staple of UK kids' literature for donkeys years (and author Michael Bond cameos in this film). Somehow, my family has missed all except the occasional episode of the animated TV series of 5 minute shorts voiced by Michael Hordern years ago so, while I know the basics of the Paddington mythology (marmalade sandwiches), I come to this film as a complete novice."
Paddington,"And it is a wonderful film. The story is simple and easy to follow, but full of momentum. The characters are all well-drawn, sympathetic, and well played (Julie Walters's tendency towards excess is, thankfully, reined in), the child players are very much better than is usual in British films, Paddington himself is utterly charming and wonderfully voiced by Ben Whishaw. Nicole Kidman is a convincing, but funny villain, and the film strikes a good balance between the prejudice necessary for a suitably dramatic story and the heartwarming humanity which leaves you uplifted at the end."
Paddington,"Paddington himself is beautifully designed, animated, and integrated into the background plates, and the CGI generally is well done – noticeable when it needs to be, and subtle and understated the rest of the time."
Paddington,"The film is often very funny, and you leave the cinema happier than when you went in."
Paddington,"Sweet, funny, fun movie."
Paddington,An English explorer visits the jungles of Peru and befriends a couple of bears. A few decades later the bears' home is destroyed and the child of the bears goes to London to find the explorer...
Paddington,"Wonderful movie, suitable for all ages. Decent plot that, unlike many children's stories, isn't random or full of holes. Very funny too - has many laugh-out-loud moments."
Paddington,There's an English quirkiness and whimsicalness that carries the whole movie and provides many of the best comedic moments.
Paddington,"Great performances by an all-star cast: Sally Hawkins, Hugh Bonneville, Peter Capaldi (of The Thick of It fame - here he is in a rare non-swearing role...), Jim Broadbent and Julie Walters. Ben Wishaw is great as the voice of Paddington as are Imelda Staunton and Michael Gambon as his (bear) parents. Nicole Kidman is convincing as the villain."
Paddington,Even the minor parts include some big names: Matt Lucas (of Little Britain fame) appears as a cabbie and Kayvan Novak (Facejacker) also has a small part.
Paddington,A great movie and not just for children.
Paddington,This film is about a family who finds a talking teddy bear in a train station. They name the teddy bear after the station that the teddy bear was found. They go through an adventure as a vivisectionist goes after Paddington.
Paddington,"Who wouldn't like ""Paddington""? A cute and warm seasonal offering, I got up early to see the first screening in the cinema. I even bought a Paddington mug yesterday to get into the spirit. And I wasn't disappointed by the film. Cuteness is all around, and the story is very fun and flows well. It's a great adventure for children and adults, and I enjoyed watching it."
Paddington,"I loved it. It didn't matter to me that myself and my husband were watching it without the cover of escorting children, family movies are probably one of the most satisfying things out there to watch when done as well as this one was."
Paddington,"Cute is an understatement to describe Paddington Bear: he is simply warm and cuddly and I fell for him wholeheartedly. I may even add PB to my Christmas list of wants, even at my great old age."
Paddington,"Adult comedies can engender one or two laughs, if you're lucky, but this family fun trip had me and the audience laughing throughout (apart from the odd serious moments where it wouldn't have been right to do so)."
Paddington,"Everything was right: the colours, the cast (except I'm not a fan of Nicole Kidman: her pert nose, pert bum or whispered speech), and again...I was entranced by the great warmth of the entire piece."
Paddington,"Folks, go see this one, whatever your age, with kids or without. You'll all love it, I'm sure."
Paddington,"My hubby hadn't wanted to see it, but he thoroughly enjoyed it. Highly recommended. I'm sure it will grace many TV screens at many Christmases for many years to come."
Paddington,Paddington (2014)
Paddington,*** (out of 4)
Paddington,Extremely delightful film about a young bear who leaves the jungles of Peru and heads for London in hopes of finding a family to adopt him. He runs into a family who gives him the name Paddington and they agree to keep him for a night but this turns into much more and soon the family is dealing with a crazy woman (Nicole Kidman) who wants to stuff the bear.
Paddington,"I must admit that the trailer for this film made it appear to be cute but I really didn't think they'd be able to pull it off. I'm glad to report that I was dead wrong because this here was one of the more entertaining live-action kids movies to come along in a great while. There's quite a bit going on in the film but it certainly benefits from a cute story, some terrific CGI and some nice human characters. The characters, including Paddington, are so enjoyable that you can't help but have fun with their adventure."
Paddington,"It should go without saying but Paddington is certainly the star here as he steals the picture with ease. The screenplay really makes him a lovable character with a lot of charm and humor. I thought there were several very funny sequences throughout the film dealing with the bear trying to get along in the city and leaving with the family. The early sequence dealing with Paddington trying out a bathroom for the first time had many great laughs. The supporting human actors are all good as well with Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins, Madeleine Harris and Samuel Joslin standing out as the family members. Kidman doesn't make for the most memorable villain but it was still nice seeing her."
Paddington,The CGI effects are another major plus because you really can't tell that the bear is fake. There's no question that special effects have came a long way and these here look superb. The bear really does seem as if he's acting along with the human actors and this here certainly makes you believe what you're watching is all the more real. PADDINGTON really is a charming little gem that works on many levels.
Paddington,"a lovely film. who rebuild the universe of a series in admirable manner. and who preserves the status of family film in wise manner. laughs and tension. a cute character and a family who reminds children literature. and London in special light. a film who remains beautiful for its old fashion flavor. because you rediscover pieces from a cinema before the trend of special effects or moral lessons or silly speeches about well known themes. it is pure delight. for each member of family. example of science of detail, fragment of art to tell a story, homage to readers of a series who has as axis the innocence, carefully preserved by the adaptation. a film . an adorable one. who gives to entertainment new nuances."
Paddington,"This is an instant classic. The raw materials, a heart-warming, but lightweight children's story are not the obvious stuff of a great film,the hybrid real life and cgi high risk. But it works, spectacularly. Translated into over thirty languages, and comprising over twenty books, the simple adventures of an anthropomorphised bear from darkest Peru have enchanted parents and children alike. Hamish McColl has done a fabulous job with the screenplay creating a story inspired by events in the books, but not telling a particular previous story."
Paddington,"The ingredients are carefully crafted. Casting is almost perfect. Hugh Bonneville is an arch paternal figure, a role popularised with his stint at Downton Abbey, a series which has enjoyed great success in the United States, broadening the film's transatlantic appeal. Nicole Kidman is wonderful in her baddie, Cruella de Ville incarnation as Millicent. All dads will love the lingering shots of her from the soles of her vertiginous heels upwards. She flounces and pounces and generally has the most fun, particularly when enhanced by her no-hoper admirer Mr Curry (Peter Capaldi). The kids, play cameo roles well, housekeeper Julie Walters is a dotty delight with prodigious drinking game skills. The only character I didn't quite buy was Sally Hawkins as the wife. Very Boho and Notting Hill, she didn't quite convince opposite Hugh Bonneville as his wife."
Paddington,"At the eleventh hour crisis struck the production when Colin Firth left the production as the voice of Paddington. But sweet are the uses of adversity, and Ben Wishaw stepped in to capture the spirit and essence of the bear perfectly."
Paddington,"Director Paul King creates a wonderfully British landscape without wallowing in nostalgia too much. Tower Bridge, Buckingham Palace, the Natural History Museum, Red telephone boxes, double decker buses and English Bobbies are of course on show, but multi -cultural bustling London is also there, saving it from a sickly sweet end."
Paddington,"Not only is the story well told, but the dialogue is crisp, funny and fresh too. The linguist daughter learns how to say ""I have been accused of insider trading and require legal representation"" in Chinese, and when Paddington is tied up in a chase wearing a policeman's helmet the local bobbies come to his aid with an ""officer in distress"" call."
Paddington,"King has some fun with nods to other movies too. The scene where the cabbies code becomes ""guidelines"" under Inquisitor Nicole Kidman echoes Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean, Paddington has to rescue his hat from a descending shutter blind as Indiana Jones did, and Kidman descends from a skylight in an attempt to capture Paddington as Tom Cruise did in Mission Impossible, with a further scene reprised as Paddington makes his escape up a metal vent shaft."
Paddington,"Ninety minutes is about right for a family film and at 95 minutes, not a second is wasted, nor dramatic lull endured. Hugh Bonneville's scene in drag is more Les Dawson than Mrs Doubtfire and works in a surreal way, Matt Lucas gets his comeuppance as an awkward cab driver in a way that British MP David Mellor would surely approve of. Some homespun philosophy about outsiders, family, and love, stay just the right side of schmaltz neatly reinforcing the story's wholesome credentials. The special effects are fabulous, particularly a flood, and the essentials, a hat, duffle coat and marmalade are all present and correct."
Paddington,"A certainty to be around for many Christmases, and years, to come."
Paddington,"Those of us who grew up with the old BBC animation of the ADVENTURES OF PADDINGTON BEAR, voiced by the wonderfully fruity Michael Hordern, might find it difficult to stomach another version of Michael Bond's well-loved tales."
Paddington,"Happily most of our skepticism was set aside: Paul King's new animated version is absolutely wonderful, with a witty script (by King and Hamish McColl), performances given with a light touch, inspired voice-overs and superb animation."
Paddington,"The story follows the book: Paddington Bear (voiced by Ben Whishaw) lives a happy life in darkest Peru with his aunt and uncle (voiced by Imelda Staunton and Michael Gambon), until an earthquake turns their world upside down. Paddington takes a boat across to London, but finds it an unfriendly city until he settles down with the Brown family. He causes complete chaos in their household but wins his way into their hearts while repelling the evil clutches of the evil Millicent (Nicole Kidman, doing a wonderful impression of Cruella de Vil from 101 DALMATIANS)."
Paddington,"The settings are vividly colored, conjuring up an imaginative London of the mind full of gray cityscapes and ideal-looking house interiors. The Browns' residence looks an ideal place to live, with the parents (Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins) leading agreeably dotty lives, and their children (Madeleine Harris, Samuel Joslin) falling in love with the accident-prone bear."
Paddington,"The script contains some excruciating puns on the word ""bear,"" and includes knowing references to MISSION, IMPOSSIBLE and THE BIRDS. As the housekeeper Mrs. Bird, Julie Walters has a wonderful time with her broad Scottish accent and selection of vacuum cleaners."
Paddington,"There are notable cameos from Matt Lucas as a timorous taxi-driver, Peter Capaldi, for once shedding his Scottish accent to play the down-at-heel neighbor Mr. Curry, and Jim Broadbent as the mittel- European immigrant Mr. Gruber."
Paddington,"The story obviously ends happily, and contains sufficient open-ended material for the possibility of a sequel at some future date. Even if you don't have children, PADDINGTON offers ninety minutes of delightful entertainment."
Paddington,"Every now and again one hears about a film that has unexpectedly captured the imagination of general audiences - and one promptly ignores such word of mouth, because it can't possibly bear any truth, could it? After enough time of hearing again and again how good it is, I've finally taken a chance to watch 'Paddington.' Happily, I could hardly be more pleased, for nearly from the very start this is an utter delight. There's a great deal thrown at us in these ninety-odd minutes, from outrageous gags and adventure fit for a kids' movie, to cheeky wit and the classic comedic hijinks of a stranger in a strange land (or in this case, of course, a bear). The notes of tragedy and introduction of a villain are customary for such fare, though I think unnecessary for the pure lighthearted lark that this could have been; there are meaningful, significant themes on hand, ranging from passing commentary on mistreatment of immigrants, dehumanization, and imperialism, to more heartwarming exploration of diversity, inclusivity, and family dynamics. The saga of a talking bipedal bear allows the effects artists to let their imagination run wild with incredible, fanciful visuals, and from one to the next the cast is clearly having a total blast with their roles. This is so much fun!"
Paddington,"Between Sally Hawkins, Hugh Bonneville, Julie Walters, Nicole Kidman, and Ben Whishaw I'm not sure who was enjoying themselves more while making this, to say nothing of all other involved. Filming locations, art direction, cinematography, music, costume design, hair, makeup, stunts, effects, characters, dialogue, scene writing, narrative, direction: in every capacity, from every corner, this is superbly well made, and is characterized by nothing if not the utmost spirit of heart and good cheer. Filmmaker Paul King has bestowed upon us a marvelous gift, something that absolutely be enjoyed by children and adults alike. I had my doubts for the past nine years, and I'm glad to say I was sorely mistaken. There are bits and pieces that one might reasonably nitpick, such as the overwrought sentimentality toward the end or the unabashed childishness of some gags; then again, this is nothing if not wholesome and earnest, and there is boundless skill, intelligence, and ingenuity in much of the humor that quite hearkens back to legends like Laurel and Hardy, Keaton, or Lloyd. There really is something for everyone here, and now that I've seen it for myself, I've a hard time believing that anyone could watch and not walk away thoroughly entertained."
Paddington,"If, like me, you've for any reason hesitated to check out this picture, I must vehemently urge you to reconsider. Take it from a perpetual cynic and skeptic - 'Paddington' is fantastic, and I'm thrilled to give it my very high, hearty, and enthusiastic recommendation! Two paws up!"
Paddingorthmen: A Viking Saga,"For a medieval fantasy flick, Northmen does look the part. It has fine cinematography and quite gory battle as the characters literally spend bulk of the movie running and fighting in nice vistas. They, however, lack the appeal or novelty to set up a grand tale it's meant to be, making the tour into foreign land a loud yet bland one."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"Story revolves around a group of Vikings, or Northmen, as they journey through unfamiliar territory. The group has internal strife and ambition for riches, but none of their story is fully fleshed out. The motives or back stories, even for the antagonist role, are often glossed over. Furthermore, the movie introduces many typical characters such lost princess and the enigmatic priest, each with their own equally monotonous issue."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"With stack of characters, it's unfortunate that none of them is actually interesting. The actors work with passable acting, but the script is basically told while they are in constant running. It buries the story as they roar and slash their way through. When the supposed dramatic scenes play out, chances are audience wouldn't be invested on these characters."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"It does possess good visual, camera work and design. There are set pieces that offer decent skirmish, both in daylight or night time. Credit when credit is due, most movies with fantasy theme often become blurry as the fight continues after dawn, but Northmen gives good graphic and lighting even in these instances. Action is presentable as well, bit crude at times, but fits the theme nonetheless."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"As an action movie, it benefits from above average presentation, however the story doesn't venture beyond the realm of mediocrity."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"During a storm, a Viking vessel sinks and the survivors are stranded on the coast of Scotland. They climb a cliff and are attacked by an army; however they defeat the enemy but one of them escapes. They find a noble woman, Inghean (Charlie Murphy), and the leader of the Vikings Asbjorn (Tom Hopper) decides to keep her to get a ransom to go to the Viking settlement Danelagh. They stumble with the Christian monk Conall (Ryan Kwanten) that helps them. Meanwhile the escapee reaches his kingdom and the king sends a group of cruel mercenaries under the command of Hjorr (Ed Skrein) and his henchman Bovarr (Anatole Taubman) to hunt the Vikings down. But Hjorr and Bovarr actually intend to kill Inghean and when they reach the Vikings, Inghean learns the true intention of Hjorr and feels that her only chance to survive is to team up with Asbjorn and his warriors."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"""Northmen - A Viking Saga"" is a highly entertaining adventure, with a full of action story, charismatic characters and great villains. The direction is tight, the cast has good performance and the fight choreography, locations, costumes, and special effects are excellent. My vote is seven."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"Title (Brazil): ""Northmen - A Viking Saga"""
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"This is a must see for all those who like sword&sandal movies. The plot is too simple. The story could have been a little more with twists and subplots, not to mention a more detailed characterization. You have a bunch of northmen who are on hostile turf, but the problem is you just don't care when someone is mortally wounded and about to die. There isn't enough of a background story, the history of all the characters, why are they the way they are, their motivations. As a viewer you are left wondering...but not in a good way. The action scenes and also the location are pretty much the only things that save the film. It's always entertaining to watch a well done fighting scene at least for me. One more thing the actors are easy on the eyes, which is another plus. Go see it."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)
Northmen: A Viking Saga,Rating: 3.7/5 stars
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"Excellent Viking film. A few, and strictly just a few representations might be historically, culturally, or factually inaccurate, but when a movie is this entertaining, all is forgiven. Pay a deaf ear to the naysayers and give it a shot. You'll be blown away by the pulsating action and the highly intense drama."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"And yeah, ""Merlin"" alumnus and current star of the TV show ""Black Sails"", Tom Hopper, displays the necessary chutzpah and body language to pass of as a believable lead in a period action film."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,'NORTHMEN: A VIKING SAGA': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"A Viking action flick, about vikings trapped in enemy territory, directed by Claudio Fah (who also helmed the direct to video sequels 'HOLLOW MAN 2' and 'SNIPER: RELOADED') and written by Mattias Bauer and Bastian Zach (who also wrote the Swiss B movie horror flick 'ONE WAY TRIP 3D'). The film stars Tom Hopper, Ed Skrein, Charlie Murphy, Ryan Kwanten, James Norton, Ken Duken, Anatole Tubman, Johan Hegg, Leo Gregory and others. I thought it was entertaining enough, to pass the time with, but nothing special or memorable."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"The film tells the story of a group of vikings, who become stranded in unfamiliar territory; when their boat crashes, on the coast of Alba in a horrific storm. They're pursued by mercenaries, sent after them by the King of Alba, as they try to make their way to a Viking settlement. They also, unintentionally, kidnap the King's daughter (Murphy). Things become very violent, quickly."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"The movie has some cool action scenes; especially considering the budget, and weak storyline. The performances aren't bad either; the directing is decent and the film looks great. If Fah had just had a better script to work with (I blame Bauer and Zach), this could have been a thrilling action flick. I really wanted to like the characters, thanks to the actors, but had no reason to. I also could not get into the story, or what was going on at all, despite cool fight scenes and decent thrills. There's definitely reasons to like things about this film; but it's mostly a miss and mediocre."

Northmen: A Viking Saga,"Sometimes the simple things seem to be the most difficult. Like finding your way back home. Then again, even with all the transportation possibilities today some have issues reaching their goal, let alone back when this movie is supposedly playing. It's a decent effort into the viking territory and it has the flair of movies from the 80s, when a group/handful of guys were trying to reach a destination or just try to stay alive."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"The effects are good, the camera is nice (copying the middle land moves we've learned to love from Peter Jackson, relishing on sights and so forth), the acting is OK too, considering the genre this is playing at and all the clichés involved. It won't be hard to guess what will be coming up most of the time, mixing a lot of known and working formulas, this is a pleasant time waster ..."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"""Northmen: A Viking Saga"" does offer some good, solid entertainment. And it is a movie that appeals mostly to a male audience. And chances are that if you like the ""Vikings"" series, then you would also find enjoyment in ""Northmen: A Viking Saga""."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"However, the story, albeit straight forward and very simplistic, offers very little in terms of layering a profound movie experience. Why? Well, because the storyline was just too simple, truth be told. The movie is about a group of marooned vikings washed ashore and having to get from point A to point B in order to reach a safe haven. And the path between points A and B is a perilous one, of course."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"What works very well in the movie is the fighting and action sequences, as they are nicely choreographed and equally nicely executed on the screen. But also the costumes and outfits were working well in favor of the movie, because they had a very authentic feel to them. And the environment where the movie was filmed also added a great deal of enjoyment to the movie."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"The characters in the movie were nicely detailed, although most of them were very generic in terms of what has previously been seen in the viking movie genre. That being said, don't get me wrong, because the people cast to portray the characters did good jobs with their characters, despite not having the most elaborate of scripts to work with. And while the soothsayer character was indeed interesting, it just seemed a bit out of place, with those supernatural powers, as it turned the movie into a fantasy movie, and not really adhering to the reality of the age in which the movie was taking place. A good or bad thing? Well, I did enjoy it, as it was nicely done. But had they opted for something else, then the movie would have had a whole other atmosphere to it. And also the monk character was somewhat of a sore thumb, especially since he was apparently so much more martially trained than everyone else. It just seemed a bit out of place."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"""Northmen: A Viking Saga"" is an enjoyable movie for sure. Just don't expect anything extraordinary. And while it is not fully up to the level of the ""Vikings"" series, then it is still a good addition to the viking movie genre."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"This is, to my knowing, the first rip-off from the Vikings series.A very sad one at that...."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"This movie has a very shaky story line, full of unbelievable holes, weak characters and, at times, comedic acting."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"You have the ever-present theme of vikings getting into Britain, this time into Scotland. OK, they are running from home, where they are at odds with the new king. So, it was easier to just grab a boat and try to reach Britain than to stay in their own land to regroup before venturing aimlessly across the sea. And they are all, at that point, unscathed, in spite of the battle they had to fight to get away."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"Then they crash, losing all their weapons and gear. They are met by a patrol of superior numbers, armed and on horse. They kill all but one, that manages to escape. Only one of them gets seriously hurt. But they get a King's daughter that was with the patrol, being taken unwillingly to her marriage."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"They manage to find a monk willing to help (oh, the parallelism is uncanny....). The monk does more than help, he becomes one of them. The King's daughter, as her father apparently prefers her dead so as not to weaken his political standing, also joins the troupe."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"Daddy sends a platoon of murderous mercenaries to 'take care' of the situation. They are led by the younger of two brothers (the much older one is under his lead....go figure that...), a very strong fighter and more than half insane."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"Well, they go dwindling each other's numbers until the final face- off, where the paradoxically good vikings win the day - just to find that Daddy brought a whole army to meet them. A whole army to meet a band of vikings. Yes."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"But fear not! They jump from a very high cliff into the ocean where, instead of being crushed by the waves against the cliff walls, they find a magical boat that must have been just lying around in wait for someone to take it for a ride...."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"If you have nothing else to do, well, watch it.....there are swords, a bunch of guys get gruesomely killed and the pretty boy gets the pretty girl at the end. Bleargh."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"Excellent cinematography and great cast elevate this well above the usual fair. The performances are strong throughout and Tom Hopper is a great leading man in the style of Chris Hemsworth. Overall a very good adventure movie directed with great flair by Claudio Fah. Looks like a much bigger budget than it was. Fight scenes handled with confidence. The production values were consistently high class, with notable scenes in forests, caves and swamps all looking suitably authentic and not remotely TV standard like so many other things. Comparisons to the TV show seem unfair as this stands on its own merits as a story. The TV show often feels padded and stretched whereas this moves at a good pace and doesn't outstay its welcome."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"Fairly elaborate Viking adventure but without historical perspective , packing bloody action , emotion , drama, brief romance and overwhelming battles . Norse Opera dealing with a group of Vikings : Tom Hopper, James Norton, Ken Dunken, among others, are shipwrecked at the Scotland coast, then a panicked race begins . There they meet a princess : Charlie Murphy, about to marry , as well as a Catholic priest, Ryan Kwanten, with real fighting skills. Then they are relentlessly pursued by an army of local warriors : Ed Skrein, Anatole Taubman, who will stop at nothing to kill them. The losers will pay with their lives. There's no time to bleed. In exile a hero will rise."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"Viking adventure full of noisy action, thrills, chills, visceral violence, sword-play and impressive battles. A well-done in comic-book level costume adventure with non-stop action from start to finish , resulting to be entertaining enough . It contains unstoppable action with merciless fights and chases with no rest, in which the small bunch of Vikings are attacked, assaulted, besieged at a tower and ultimately surrounded next to a cliff. The flick being played by a good cast of notorious actors as Tom Hopper, Ryan Kwanten, James Norton, Ed Skrein, and only woman : Charlie Murphy, all of them are pretty well. The motion picture was competently directed by Claudio Fah at his best . This filmmaker is a craftsman expert on sequels , such as : Hollow Man 2 , Sniper : Ultimate Kill ,Sniper : Reloaded , Beyond Valkyrie , among others."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"This basic epic costumer belongs to Viking subgenre that was especially successful in the Sixties , there are various films such as : the classic The Vikings 1958 with Kirk Douglas , Tony Curtis , Janet Leigh . The long Shipts by Jack Cardiff with Richard Widmark , Sidney Poitier . The Last of the Vikings 1961 by Mario Bava with Edmund Purdom, George Ardisson . Knives of the Avenger 1966 by Mario Bava with Cameron Mitchell , Fausto Tozzi . The Norsemen 1978 by Charles B Pierce with Cornel Wilde , Mel Ferrer . The Viking Queen 1966 by Don Chaffey with Don Murray , Andrew Keir . The Viking Sagas 1995 by Michael Chapman with Ralph Moeller , Steve Ole Thorsen. The 13th Warrior 1999 by John McTiernan with Antonio Banderas , Diane Venora, Tony Curran, Omar Shariff , among others ."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"I have a bunch of DVD & Blu-ray over Vikings saga, those brave warriors quite often didn't upset me, this is another fine picture made on location in South Africa is an above average production, without those countless special effects on blue screen, here l really noticed just a few, the cave shooting is real, waterfall and many wide open places in fact matching with Scotland were the story happens, althought the casting are practically unknown, they made a decent job, weren't in the same level of the series Vikings of course, but it a easy amusement in this small size scale that won't regret the true movie lovers!!"
Northmen: A Viking Saga,Resume:
Northmen: A Viking Saga,First watch: 2018 / How many: 1 / Source: Blu-ray / Rating: 7
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"running. fights. vikings. and a last scene who impose a prequel. not surprising but decent and this could be a real good point. because it respects expectations of its public. an action film in clothes of history. inspired but the series Vikings. using, in not bad manner, a lot of clichés. remembering Lord of Ring in few scenes. and being an interesting try to propose not a new story but a decent exercise to tell it. all is well known. but the desire to be more than one of many action movies , proposing a story of survive, friendship and crumbs of faiths is a nice option. and the acting, far to be impressive, is not real bad. in essence, a correct cake respecting , in each detail, the recipes of genre. and the flavor of fairy tale, and the references to Odyssey are virtues for a film about vikings and theirs adventures in foreign land. only strange fact - maybe the title . but the new parts of a possible trilogy could save appearances."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"This is a movie that I liked way more then anyone else. One prime complaint is about rooting for the Vikings and in most cases (see 'Pathfinder') they are not. But just like any other group, there are good Vikings as well and Asbjorn (Tom Hopper), is a good Viking. Why is he good? If you watch the movie you will see he is not really comfortable with the way the Vikings act, and he is really saddened when his men die. Spoilers ahead: Watch the scene where he saves Princess Inghean (Charlie Murphy) from death near the falls. He refuses to abandon her (despite her being a captive), and the favor is returned when she saves him from quicksand. The real bad guys were the Scots especially her father King Dunchaid (Danny Keogh) who hires mercenaries Hjorr (Ed Skrein) and his henchman Bovarr (Anatole Taubman) to kill her, because the Vikings killed to of his best men and captured her, and he did not want to look weak. What also works is the presence of the fighting Christian monk Conall (Ryan Kwanten), and you see how the Vikings, Inghean and Cohall, not only band together, but not only learn from each other in order to survive, but have faith and trust (especially Asbjorn who admits trusting Inghean, and Inghean at the end of the movie has such faith in him, she follows him over a cliff into the water). \The scenery was spectacular, and Charlie Murphy (what a name for a woman) is a knockout. 9/10 stars."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"High production values and a very good cast make this a movie that I watched several times and will again. This is not a ripoff of any tv series and feels more like a d&d adventure w/fantasy elements. Sure, there are unbelievable items but no more than any other movie so such criticism is silly. The Vikings are the heroic figures in this tale and there is a fighting monk who joins them. Several actors did great work here as did the director as this could have been a real dud in lesser hands."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"I watched Northmen in a sneak preview in a German cinema, so please don't wonder at my language skills."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"I really like such epic movies so i had great expectations. The characters are distinguishable and the main actor has the necessary charisma. The plot is easy, so don't expect to much ! Thats the only thing what i dislike about the movie."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,The cinematography and the high-resolution graphics with great recordings from swiss and south African landscape create a heated atmosphere.
Northmen: A Viking Saga,Especially the character of a monk is well acted.
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"All in all the movie is no must see because of the simple story, but the distincitv characters, the good recordings of the landscape, and well acted fighting scenes make the movie to a Sunday evening activity."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,I love Vikings (the ancient Scandinavian seafarers and the TV series alike) so I couldn't miss this one. And I was seriously afraid that this could be a major delusion but it was not!
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"On the contrary: starting from the very beginning when they wake up on Scottish coast, the images, the locations (really amazing), the characters, the fightings and the story completely caught me."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"Of course it is not a masterpiece. Conall (the monk played by Ryan Kwanten) couldn't help but remind of Athelstan, the plot is far from unpredictable and Darrel D'Silva (Gunnar) kills too many enemies for his age"
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"But Ed Skrein once more (have you seen Ill Manors?) is a wonderful bad guy and finds his match in Anatole Taubman as (a great) supporting villain. What more to say? Tom Hopper biceps are mesmerizing, Charlie Murphy is pretty and if you like Vikings you won't be disappointed."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"I really liked this movie, start to finish. Someone says it's a rip-off of Vikings. So, is that really a bad thing? That's like saying Vito Bratta's no good because he rips off Eddie Van Halen a bit. My point: rip-off or not, it's a very entertaining Viking movie! I liked the characters. I don't think it's a spoiler to say not everyone lives to the end of the movie. So without detail, I felt for the ones who died. That means I enjoyed the characters. It was fast-paced, and kept my attention throughout."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"The plot wasn't perfect, there were some things that really needed the director saying, ""Well, shoot, the only way for them to survive this next scene is if a badger chews off the leg of one of the bad guys."" (No, there wasn't a badger, but I hope the point was made.) So I liked the story, liked the pace, liked the characters, liked the battles. That for me makes it an 8/10."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"This movie was downright awesome, just AWESOM! I had low expectations, but man this movie was really good."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"I am a guy who rates movies slightly differently. I try to take it into context what it is, the budget and I like action movies with good plot thrown in."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"This movie is made for guys who like Lord of the Rings, and movies about vikings and adventure. The adventure being can they survive being hunted by the king."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"This is what I call a man's movie. Guys who love action films will love this. The characters are likable, and given the budget, some of the acting and stunts pulled off were pretty good."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"THe movie made characters likable which is important, so in the end you are pulling for them to make it."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"I am not sure if their is a sequel or if their is meant to be one, but this is must watch MOVIE."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,I give this a 9.5 out of 10. Pleasantly surprised.
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"Photograph was fantastic! This film NEVER felt cheaply done in any way. Acting was great as well, although I'm not familiar with any of the players --- guess what? --- it doesn't matter!
The story kept pace well, and I never knew what was going to happen.
The scenery was nearly to die for. (I would never die for scenery, though.)
And, even though it's all about big, tough Vikings, they managed, like they always do, to toss a cute girl into the story!! Fun Time! Give it a Watch."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"Much better than I expected. I went it prepared for a low budget, made-for-TV film. But no, this is a very well made film."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,We follow the tale of a band of exiled Vikings as they are pursued across Scotland by a mercenary war band.
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"Good writing, good acting, memorable characters and good visual effects. It also benefits from excellent fight choreography, great costumes, wonderful mountainous scenery and lots of well-done gritty battles. If you love medieval adventure, definitely give this one a try."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"My only complaint for this movie was that the size of the pursuing mercenary warband kept changing. It was hard to tell if they were 8 or 80. This was particularly noticeable at the battle at the bridge. Perhaps it was a vanguard force ahead of a main force, but the director should have made that more clear."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"In any case, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. This movie was very similar to the Clive Owen King Arthur movie. Similar style and tone and characters. If you enjoyed that film, you'll probably like this one."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"Asbjorn and his Viking men are stranded in Scotland after losing their boat. They encounter a band of soldiers transporting princess Inghean to her wedding. After a fierce battle, they take her hostage. She has special powers of perception. King Dunchaid sends his men after them. They find a Christian monk who could guide them home."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,It's a lower budget action adventure. It has no big names. The production and CGI is lower level. It's a rather simple chase fight movie. The plot does take a few questionable turns. It needs work to make it more exciting and the characters more compelling. The lead has limited charisma. This has some watch-ability value but not great even as a B movie.
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"A small boat full of exiled Vikings get marooned on Scotland, which doesn't want them either. Asbjorn (Tom Hopper) leads the group who happen to defeat a troop of soldiers and capture the princess (Charlie Murphy) the film's sole eye candy. They plan to ransom her off to her father for enough money to buy their way into a Viking settlement in the south. The plans go bad when they find out the rescue army wants to kill the princess, which they claim are the orders of the King. The Vikings are aided by a fighting monk (Ryan Kwanten) with a staff. Oh yes the princess can read the ground too. Ed Skrein leads the Scots who appear to be one chromosome away from Orcs."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"The film consists of Vikings running away from Scots, getting caught by Scots, fighting Scots and running away from Scots. The love story doesn't develop. The fight scenes weren't bad, but not memorable. Acting isn't bad for people who grunt."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity. Charlie Murphy cleavage. Tom Hopper beefcake."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"""Vikings rip-off"", ""catching the Vikings success wave"" and all those other down-talking phrases might be true. But this movie did not entertain me well because the TV series is a success. It gave me joy and excitement because the genre catches me and because it is well made. There are Vikings in this movie, and it tells a Vikings story - that is nothing that the TV series can claim as a monopoly. It's part of the genre."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"I am also writing this review with the background of this year's Oscars, elevating the more intellectual movies that I do not neglect their craftsmanship and success - but that were totally boring to me."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"Northmen is a movie of my liking. And I am sure it will find your excitement too if you like the genre. As such, it is well made. Actors, scenery, fight choreography, costumes and atmosphere offer everything I expected. Little shortcomings of the story are more or less irrelevant to me because I did not expect more. In fact, I expected the story to be simple and genre-like because I just wanted to enjoy an exciting and entertaining Vikings movie."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,And that what Northmen is all along. Charisma and acting of the main characters will stay in my memory. The casting is excellent and together with the scenic atmosphere and action this movie gave me satisfaction from start to end.
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"Pretty good Viking adventure/action movie,although not a great one and needs a lot of improvement. Maybe a little more budget would have helped the movie in terms of cinematography and action but what it is,the movie is very fast paced,exciting and the acting was solid by most of the actors. I really liked Ryan Kwanten's role in it. It added some emotional layer and also credibility to the movie. The lead actor,although wasn't outstanding,made for a very dependable lead for the movie and did his job well. The movie has a lot of clichés of adventure movies like this but it kinda helped the movie to be interesting from the beginning to the end. Some of the scenes and twists in the movie felt rushed though and seemed like it was thrown in there just to keep the plot going or the characters to survive. In total,it's not groundbreaking but it's worth watching once or twice for the fast paced actions and direction. And this movie is definitely better than Vikingdom that came out two or three years go and Outcast that came out a few months ago. Outcast isn't a Viking movie but it's an adventure movie like this but was pretty lame."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,Imagine you recently discovered that there is a strong possibility you may gave descended from a Viking King. Your history minded self and a band of men are caught in a storm in a Longship that was breaking apart near land. You survive by washing up on a scant beach with straight massive cliffs as your only escape before the high tide returns.
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"Exhausted, most make it to the top to rest and recuperate, but you have been spotted by a small band of armed men who take you as hostiles and engage you in combat leaving behind a surprise in a horse drawn wagon with a princess inside while one rides away to raise the alarm. The landscape of mountains, gorges, moors and an unusual stone tower created a feeling of a lookout post that could have been seen in the movie ""Willow"" From this, a series of small bloody engagements cuts down the numbers on both sides as it is apparent the royal princess is in as much danger as you. In a time when people were much more in tune with the nature, certain sensitivities to the earth may have inspired some to read seemingly supernatural signs of the earth as graphically displayed by the princess with hand bloodied, then not as it gave her insight to advise the leader that they must move ahead and out of danger."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"No doubt the combat sequences would have challenged the endurance of even the strongest men, but how can one sit there watching without some adrenaline flow, especially when those killed on the bad guy side are replaced from the unknown source as if they didn't read their script as they resume the chase and the fight."
Northmen: A Viking Saga,"This movie didn't start out so captivating, but seemed to keep me involved each time I started to change channels. Rates a 5 or 6, but since I was dragging my own Viking baggage along in thought, I boost it to a 7!"
ton,"9 December 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Paddingon. I've been looking forward to this film for months and it didn't disappoint. Just in case there is the remotest chance that nobody knows......Paddington is the tale of a bear from deepest darkest Peru who comes to London and takes up residence with the Brown Family. There are all the recognisable elements from the children's programme, from the blue duffel coat down to the marmalade sandwich kept in Paddington's hat for emergencies. The baddie was played exquisitely by Nicole Kidman, a job she seems to relish. Mr Brown was excellently played by Hugh Bonneville, who seemed to carry a tiny but welcome piece of Lord Grantham into the character. The addition of Julie Walters as Mrs Bird was inspiring as she manages to bring her usual brilliance to the old housekeeper who had been with the family for years. The animation was extraordinary and had the whole audience laughing out loud. There was an audible gasp at one point when Paddington was in peril, and viewers young and old all sat up in their seats hoping against hope that our hero would survive. I went with a group of people of which I was definitely the youngest, the oldest being 78. This is definitely a film for the whole family."
Pitch Perfect 2,The three-time champs Barden Bellas has an embarrassing incident when Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) flashes the audience during a performance for the President. They face punishment and replaced on the tour by the German Das Sound Machine. Beca (Anna Kendrick) starts an internship with a record producer (Keegan-Michael Key) keeping it a secret from the Bellas. Chloe (Brittany Snow) is more driven than ever before. Emily Junk (Hailee Steinfeld) is a legacy and joins the group. They vow to win the World Championship to regain their standing.
Pitch Perfect 2,I really like the first movie. The girls are lovable. Their friendship is charming. There is just the right amount of humor. This one has made a few changes. Adding Hailee Steinfeld is nice. Elizabeth Banks' directing skills are functional. The girls remain charming. I personally like Rebel Wilson although there may be too much of her in this one. The problem is that the humor seems dumber. I don't mean it's simply broader and more coarse. I mean it seems stupider and less well written. The whole movie feels like a step down.
Pitch Perfect 2,I hated this movie almost as soon as it started. Everything was just off. It tried way too hard to be funny forcing Rebel Wilson to have to act extra weird and quirky as opposed to just naturally weird and quirky. Becca's working at a lame recording studio while trying to tell the Bellas she's going to quit. There's like two or three new girls that I can't remember because they're not memorable.
Pitch Perfect 2,"Then they go on this lame camping expedition where Audrey now works having graduated. The group of German singers they're going up against really suck and wouldn't even be hard to beat except that the Bellas suck too. Their end performance was crap especially compared to the first movie. Pitch Perfect was hilarious, charming, original, and had great performances. Pitch Perfect 2 was strained and pointless."
Pitch Perfect 2,"After a humiliating command performance at Lincoln Center, the Barden Bellas enter an international competition that no American group has ever won in order to regain their status and right to perform."
Pitch Perfect 2,"Pitch Perfect comes back with a sequel, directed by Elizabeth Banks. Everyone is familiar with these characters by now and we all wanted to see what could happen to them after the first movie. So the good things in this acapella world aside, now we are witnessing those characters growing older and becoming real people. This film allows us to spend more time on characters that people love, to tell more of their stories and to see where these women be at three years later. While in the first one it was more about coming together, bonding and being freshmen; this film mainly deals with the notion of graduation as their in majority in their last year of college, companionship they have in college that will last forever as Bellas will always be Bellas, moving on, breaking apart, leaving the nest, staring life right in the face and going their separate ways. However they find themselves right back where they started: as underdogs of acapella. There are a lot going on this time, plot- and character -wise. Some endearing elements were taken back from the first film such as the romance between Beca and Jesse, that keep all the component in harmony as they are settled characters. Indeed they are a nice balance to the melodramatic aspect of the movie, grounded to the real stakes of this world. Yet once again Fat Amy, starring Rebel Wilson, is very charismatic. She embodies a confident woman that never thinks about her size at all. Proving that your body type doesn't determine your fate in life. Giving her a real love story with Bumper is such a good idea as she really deserves it and both actors have a great chemistry together. John Michael Higgins' character smoothly delivers his misogynic lines such as ""Let's hear it from the girls too ugly to be cheerleaders!"", and casual racism throughout the movie is even funnier this time around!"
Pitch Perfect 2,"Moreover, new girls fit right into the dynamic of the group. They're all the same characters but pushed a little bit further, they're a little bit bigger, crazier and global. Hailee Steinfeld's character represents what Pitch Perfect has become which is that kind of bonding enthusiasm and likability. People will identify with the movie for different reasons but ultimately for the joy and happiness it spreads. Obviously men are not the targeted demographic of this movie - or basically people who don't watch Glee. Nonetheless, if you just enjoy music this film will get points with you. Musically, the songbook is far hipper with a younger song selection. Executive music producers J.Jordan and J.Michels have ensured that every performances are note-perfect and soundtrack album ready; which I have to admit rather detracts any sense of realism: it's not humanly possible to sing so in-sync spontaneously. Plus, jokes are all amazing, not one falls flat. You clearly know where the movie goes from the beginning but this film is not here for an Oscar, it's just here to be fun and show some good acapella. Finally, Banks has crafted a sequel that's edgier, sexier and best of all more female centered than the first one. Showing that women can be as funny as men, even funnier. So get over it, picthes!"
Pitch Perfect 2,"Overall Pitch Perfect 2 proved once again that acapella is not lame at all, with a nerdy and inspirational movie and with much more sophisticated layered music."
Pitch Perfect 2,". . . may be stereotypical L Words, but PITCH PERFECT 2 tops its predecessor as the most harmonious A Cappella flick ever. The Germans shape up so well in the early going that their eventual showdown with the Barden Belles seems sure to be a David versus Goliath affair, fought entirely on a totally sandy shore this time. Put another way, it's the Nazi Blitzkrieg against France. At my showing, film goers were on the edge of their seats, fearing that the Na--oops, that the Germans would win, or, worse, that the Belles would be called the winners on some sort of technicality, when they had been clearly out-classed. However, due to clever writing and innovative thinking, this sequel produces a crowd-pleasing climax that seems not only plausible but well-earned. Though the life of these Belles beyond their competitions still seems a little too pat and Tinsel Townish, their Hollywood ending on the World Stage is 100% satisfying."
Pitch Perfect 2,"Let me lay my cards out there straightaway. I'm a 31 year old bloke, married with two kids, who loves films and music."
Pitch Perfect 2,And I love this film.
Pitch Perfect 2,"I Ioved the first film, and this one builds on it. But you have to appreciate that the film is based around college. For anyone that's actually been to college they should have experienced parties/people/incidents replicated in this film. I don't really understand why people show so much disdain for the 'childish' humour!"
Pitch Perfect 2,That aside...
Pitch Perfect 2,"Hats off to Elizabeth Banks for her directorial debut, you'd never know there was any change from the first film. And her inserts with John Michael Higgins are excellent, if you take them at face value for exactly what they are intended to be; humour! And pretty sexist, misogynistic humour!"
Pitch Perfect 2,"Anna Kendrick is, as always, stunning (yes, the wife knows!) and simply brilliant. Shows just how much of an actress she is having improvised almost half her lines and proves once again that she can actually sing (albeit that the singing is not on set and pre-recorded)."
Pitch Perfect 2,The rest of the cast is brilliant and it's nice to see a little more of Esther Dean actually singing/rapping rather than her usual producing.
Pitch Perfect 2,"Hailee Steinfeld has stepped in seamlessly. I don't think we saw enough of Rebel Wilson though, reckon there'll be a few deleted scenes that didn't make it."
Pitch Perfect 2,Good to see a lot of humour applied to the Ashley/Jessica situation (unless you know the film you won't get this).
Pitch Perfect 2,The final song was actually very good. Maybe not as unexpected as the first film but brilliant with an original start and an excellent surprise at the end that I think added a very personal and moving touch.
Pitch Perfect 2,It will be a shame if the franchise is over!
Pitch Perfect 2,"I wouldn't call myself a fan of musicals, but I do love my ""pitches"" (term used by the characters of this movie just in case you were unaware of that). And I did miss them while they were gone. And it looks like this one was so successful, they will be back. And while most male actors here (even those who ""survived""/came back from the first movie) are nothing more than a filler (you could argue they are having cameos), the executive for whom Kendricks character is working is pure gold (you might have seen some comedy skits of his)."
Pitch Perfect 2,"Other than that, we get a great mixture of female bonding together, fights in the family, a new member, a new ""villain"" (""ze Germans"" this time around) and a lot of Acapella. Well of course we do. One of the funniest skits is when towards the end we get that while trying to cross the street ... you'll either laugh or feel annoyed by it. For me it was the former. Same can be applied to the rest of the movie. And while I loved this one too (as I did the first one), I'm not sure a third one is/was necessary ... but I sure will Aca-watch it!"
Pitch Perfect 2,"Pitch Perfect 2 is a 2015 American musical comedy film directed by Elizabeth Banks and written by Kay Cannon. It is a sequel to the 2012 film Pitch Perfect, which was loosely adapted from Mickey Rapkin's non- fiction book, titled Pitch Perfect: The Quest for Collegiate A Cappella Glory. The film centers on the fictional Barden University and The Bellas, an-all female a capella singing group. The film features an ensemble cast that includes Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Brittany Snow, Ester Dean, Hana Mae Lee, and Alexis Knapp. It was released on May 15, 2015 by Universal Pictures."
Pitch Perfect 2,"Plot Of The Movie: Following an incident involving Fat Amy having a wardrobe malfunction at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the Barden Bellas are suspended from the circuit of a capella performing. In order to regain their status, the Bellas enter the international competition—a colossal task since no American team has ever won."
Pitch Perfect 2,I loved these sexy women and this perfect number 1 movie.
Pitch Perfect 2,"It only took 3 years until they came up with a sequel to the first ""Pitch Perfect"" movie. Let me start this review here by saying that I did not like the first film and I thought it was like 2.5 weaker Glee episodes added together. So I was very much surprised to see how well it was received. And I was even more surprised to see another director in charge here, namely actress Elizabeth Banks. I guess they even wanted to go with the entire girl power thingey also behind the camera. Unsurprisingly, this sequel got worse reception than the original, but still mostly positive. And also unsurprisingly, I also believe this film here does not deserve any of its praise. Banks' direction and Steinfeld's addition made me curious enough to give it a go, but I was disappointed again."
Pitch Perfect 2,"Let's start with the plot here. The Steinfeld story is basically a recycled version of Kendrick's story in the first film. And then they included some struggles about the direction the band is taking and some struggles between Kendrick's character and the other band members. At the beginning, the band really messes up, but predictably it all works out really well at the end again with their outdoor performance in Denmark in front of a huge crowd. The story is really really generic here and not creative at all. I don't think you can blame screenwriter Kay Cannon here. It's mostly Mickey Rapkin's fault because he delivered weak base material here."
Pitch Perfect 2,"As a whole, the film could have been kept a lot more essential and that way it would have run for 100 minutes max and that would have been fine. I personally believe that this was a missed opportunity here. The weak script lets talented actresses like Anna Kendrick and especially Hailee Steinfeld not show us the talent they possess. On a more negative note about the actresses, people need to stop trying to make Rebel Wilson happen. She is not funny and this has nothing to do with her physics. Actually she is the one whose approach to comedy is every single time entirely based on her clumsy chubby appearance and it gets repetitive so quickly. As a whole, this film was equally disappointing as the first, if not more. Still, in order to end the review on a more positive note, the singing performances and songs in here were fun to listen to I think. Some really catchy tunes and the ending with ""Flashlight"" was a thing of beauty. But it cannot make up for everything that went wrong before that. I do not recommend ""Pitch Perfect 2"". Thumbs down."
Pitch Perfect 2,"They're back, pitches! The Barden Bellas, the Treblemakers, even that Cups song is back, if you're a huge fan of the first film, like I am, then you're going to have a blast with PITCH PERFECT 2, because it's just as fun, just as exciting, just as hilarious and those covered songs and their renditions are just as catchy, you can't help but like this movie. And I didn't know Oscar nominee Hailee Steinfeld could rock a tune, but she'll definitely leave you impressed."
Pitch Perfect 2,"I had my concerns at first, I thought that if the story would only be about the Bellas entering a world tournament and nothing more to it, then we would be in for a shallow unappealing sequel, but writer Kay Cannon and first time feature director Elizabeth Banks put the Bellas back in a place where they would have to relearn, regroup and find the sound again. What makes these ""Pitch Perfect"" movies loved by millions is that it's about this group of misfit girls working together as an underdog team. In this case, the goliath, the drago, if you will, is a German team called Das Sound Machine, they know their stuff, they seem to be perfect in both their physique and their choreography, and they're intimidating."
Pitch Perfect 2,"The sequel does its best to explore some of the key characters a bit further this time around. It explores the somewhat awkward romances between Bumper and Fat Amy, and between Benji and Hailee Steinfeld's character, Emily. And the Bellas have to also come to terms with the harsh reality that they're now seniors, it's time to not be afraid to move on and give the baton to the next generation. Which is why I can see how this franchise could go on forever, and I don't think you and I would mind at all if Universal Pictures made PITCH PERFECT 23, for example. Even the Bellas' fearless leader, Beca (Anna Kendrick) is distracted because she's trying to balance her commitment to her team and her new intern gig and her dream of becoming a music producer."
Pitch Perfect 2,"I gotta give mad respect to Elizabeth Banks for taking this on as her first feature directorial debut. She produced and championed the first ""Pitch Perfect"", she's one of the folks who fought to make the first film happen. And now, with this she's proved herself to be as talented a leader as she is an actress. PITCH PERFECT 2 really makes me look forward to many more great movies made by director Elizabeth Banks. And if you've come to theaters hoping to once again be laughing your ass off at whatever Rebel Wilson's Fat Amy does, o, you are in for a treat, my friend. One of the funniest women alive will not disappoint you. The things she says, she even gets to sing solo in this one, Rebel's got tricks up her sleeves, you will crack up, I guarantee it."
Pitch Perfect 2,"One of the many things that I like about this movie is its theme of mentorship. It's a scary thought to turn the page and enter the next chapter of your life. The pressure is heavy. Whether it be being a freshman at the same college that your parent went to or finding yourself having to do a job you don't like just to get to that one job you really want. Sometimes we think we can handle everything on our own but fact of the matter is, we will have to ask someone for advice and then we'll have to turn that advice into action, finding the right mentor is important and being a mentor to someone is equally important. So I'm glad that PITCH PERFECT 2 is not just about throwing the Bellas in a world competition, although it is fun to see a cappella groups from other countries, and see their different ethnic costumes and the songs they cover as well. But that world competition in Copenhagen is just a small part of this film. I think you're going to like the big chunk of it, and just like how you've watched the first ""Pitch Perfect"" film a thousand times over, I know I have, you're going to do the same to PITCH PERFECT 2 Read more at Ramascreen.Com"
Pitch Perfect 2,"The film starts with the Bardon Bellas at the top of their game until a wardrobe malfunction in front of the President makes them underdogs once more: their only chance of redemption is the World Acapella Championships, in which they will face uber-foes, the massively efficient Das Sound Machine. But Beca has other things on her mind..."
Pitch Perfect 2,"If you saw Pitch Perfect – and you probably did if you're going to see this one – then you won't get many surprises. But you will get a similar amount of enjoyment, because this film doesn't try to do anything other than give you more of what worked the first time. Rebel Wilson's role is expanded, some of the Bellas are almost invisible, and Hailee Steinfeld gets to play the closest thing to an actual character."
Pitch Perfect 2,"And the musical numbers are all good fun, too. Music is a funny thing: it can deliver up moments which grip you by the throat and bring tears to your eyes. The last time I remember that happening was when Bruce Robinson appears on stage at the festival in Still Crazy, and there is a similar moment here, which I absolutely loved."
Pitch Perfect 2,"Incidentally film-makers, please learn about female anatomy: the TV announcers comment about what was visible referred to the internal bit, not the external bit."
Pitch Perfect 2,"Hey there it's Robbie K, back with another movie review to help you get some insight into the latest movies. Today I throw my hat into the ring of the latest singing movie Pitch Perfect 2, a sequel that has been most anticipated for quite some time. With it's predecessor becoming an instant ""classic"" in the A capella world, going so far to inspire singing competitions, surely this sequel had some potential to rock the ear drum world. From the trailers, here is what you might expect:"
Pitch Perfect 2,1. Comedy 2. Toe Tapping Tunes 3. A cute story
Pitch Perfect 2,"However, in the world of sequels you never know what will come out of the woodwork, so here is what you get:"
Pitch Perfect 2,"1. Comedy In terms of Comedy, Pitch Perfect 2's greatest strength is the ability to make you laugh. The trailer showing Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) showing off her lower anatomy is only the tip of the iceberg in this installment. You will be bombarded with one liners that are sure to be the next T-shirt or picture meme, including that famous use of Aca into vocabulary. The writers spared no expense to cram this movie with ridiculous quotes, often having our Barden Bellas go to extraordinary lengths to deliver their lines. What was the result? Most of the audience was rolling on the floor laughing, some even to tears at the comedy at hand. Wilson in particular takes the cake for the most laughs, using her weight and her blunt way of speaking to land well-timed, hilarious, dialogue. Even the slapstick comedy involving the setting is fun, especially when you see the responses of the other girls at what occurred. But perhaps the third factor that made the comedy so fun, was integrating some of the jokes into singing. Whether it was Fat Amy performing an act, or someone screwing up a lyric, Pitch Perfect 2 adds some quality comedy in their song numbers to give us a small break from the other comedy. But for all the good of the comedy, there are some limitations. For one thing they did too much of a good thing in the jokes, and for this reviewer some of the one-liners got stale. I mean how many weight jokes or sex references do we need in a two hour time frame? The second mistake was not balancing the comedy between the Bellas. Oh sure each of them got at least one line into the phrase, but this sequel focused heavily on Fat Amy and left some of the others in the dust. I always used to enjoy Becca's sarcasm as a joke, but even that got drowned by the simple slapstick of this movie. Finally the writers went a little too far with their racial/sexist jokes in both intensity and number. Some of the jokes are more insulting than funny, and the constant bashing throughout the movie had me shaking my heads and praying that no protests or boycotts would come underway."
Pitch Perfect 2,2. Songs:
Pitch Perfect 2,"So if you saw the first movie, you know that covers are the other life force of this series. Pitch Perfect 2 does a great job bringing their versions of popular songs into the mix, and making you want to sing and dance the night away. Songs are mashed together in a recipe of success that covered all genres, somehow being spun in a direction that made me like a Taylor Swift song. They even did a better job integrating our girls into the mix, helping to expand the track horizon. Best of all, I didn't have to hear I Saw The Sign performed ten times in one movie, which was perhaps the most annoying part of Pitch Perfect 1. Throw in the filler songs that helped transition the scenes, and you have one soundtrack I'll be looking to buy down the line. However the music still pales compared to its predecessor. Despite Pitch Perfect 2 having some really good tunes, the numbers still weren't as impressive as I had hoped. The final battle in particular was rather lackluster and simple, though the Bellas number did rock, and I found myself bored with the performances of the other groups."
Pitch Perfect 2,3. Story
Pitch Perfect 2,"We all know this movie isn't about the story, but take a look back at what we had in the first movie. Pitch Perfect brought college life to the screen, helping introduce a new world for Becca that included getting involved, music, friends, and love. It was simple and predictable, but done well that tied the other aspects together. Not the case in Pitch Perfect 2. This sequel sacrificed a lot of plot for extra laughs, essentially shredding the foundation to which I enjoyed in the first. Sure there was the establishment of a rival team to help spur the plot, and there was even a moral filled tale of embracing change. Heck there were even a few cutesy love stories thrown into the mix. But this movie really diluted their character development down into a rather basic mashup of half baked plot lines. I didn't feel quite as attached to the characters, my mind only wondering what the next stunt or joke would be."
Pitch Perfect 2,"So from my skewed review what can we take away? Pitch Perfect 2 is a really fun and enjoyable sequel that is sure to entertain a majority of the world. The comedy heavy theme and dialogue is going to make you laugh, and the soundtrack will have you tapping your toes away. Despite the lack of balance and weaker story, I have to recommend you go and see this film in theaters (like you actually wouldn't)."
Pitch Perfect 2,My scores overall are:
Pitch Perfect 2,Comedy/Music: 8.0 Movie Overall: 8.0
Pitch Perfect 2,"Threee years may have passed, but ""Pitch Perfect 2"" feels more like a TV episode than a full-fledged movie. Which may or may not be a good thing, depending on what you're looking for, but as a sequel, it's a mixed bag. The Bellas' story was all over the place, and despite a varied singing group, all of their appeal lies in Rebel Wilson. I mean, yeah,you could say she's all fart jokes, but her ""I'm so fly"" persona is put to good use."
Pitch Perfect 2,"The real reason to watch this is the lineup of side players (John Michael Higgins, Elizabeth Banks, David Cross, Snoop Dogg). The focused humor and killer lines belong to these actors; chief among them Keegan-Michael Key, who flat-out owns this movie as a self-absorbed record producer. That guy is hilarious."
Pitch Perfect 2,6/10
Pitch Perfect 2,"When I watched the original ""Pitch Perfect"" a number of years ago, I was disappointed in an experience that I felt wasn't sure of itself. That movie struggled to figure out whether to be grounded in semi-serious character development or fully embrace the comedy. In this sequel, however, they choose to fully embrace the comedy, and at least for me that was a decision that led to more entertaining experience."
Pitch Perfect 2,"For a basic plot summary, ""Pitch Perfect 2"" sees a return of the Borden Bellas...but only until they make themselves a national embarrassment after some ""exposure"" from Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson). Now, with the program about to be put on academic probation, it begins to fracture from within. Beca (Anna Kendrick) is spending just as much time on her own music career, while the routines just don't seem to be coming together like they used to. It takes freshman newcomer Emily (Hailee Steinfeld) to rally the troops and compete in the seemingly unwinnable ""Worlds"" competition featuring the dominant German squad."
Pitch Perfect 2,"Even though I am nowhere near the target audience of this movie (30 year-old male), I found this one to be a pretty entertaining experience because of its willingness to embrace its own silly humor throughout. Instead of trying to ground this movie in any sense of reality, it goes all-out for the jokes and music and I think it fits the style of director Elizabeth Banks better. Once you think of it as a pure comedy, it makes it a lot easier to get through."
Pitch Perfect 2,"Another great addition to the franchise was the Steinfeldt character, who breathes some new life and youthful exuberance into all proceedings. Without the new perspective given by her character, this could have been a pretty large repeat of the original. Steinfeldt can sing and act with equal measure (and both at a very high level), and is set up perfectly to be the star of subsequent sequels should Kendrick tire of the mantle."
Pitch Perfect 2,"Overall, ""Pitch Perfect 2"" was more fun for me than the original. It doesn't try to sell itself as anything other than a comedy, the songs are catchy and fun (as usual), and the Steinfeld performance is mesmerizing. This genre will never be my favorite, but it didn't struggle to finish this film like I did the first one."
Pitch Perfect 2,"'Pitch Perfect' was a bit of a sleeper hit. I hadn't even heard of it when two people I knew told me it was their new favourite film in quick succession. It didn't sound like my kind of a movie but I thought I'd give it a go nevertheless. To my surprise I found myself really enjoying it and so was quite pleased to see they were making a sequel. Sequels are notorious for losing the magic of the original, particularly comedies which seem on a hiding to nothing most of the time. However, I found myself enjoying this one just as much as I had the original."
Pitch Perfect 2,"Nearly the full cast had returned (always a good sign) and there were a few adjustments to the amount of lines particular characters were getting, determined by how popular they were in the first. The character 'Fat Amy' who was a real fan-favourite in the original had a very noticeable increase in lines. Elizabeth Banks took over the directing role for this one, in her first full feature film at the helm. I think she did a pretty good job for the most part. One thing I'd suggest she got wrong though was the final performance by the 'Bellas'. It simply wasn't good enough to justify winning the World Championship. In fact one of the few other performances we actually see in full by 'Das Sound Machine' was noticeably better. We were supposed to be swayed by the crowd simply cheering louder for the 'Bellas' but that wasn't fooling any intelligent audience member."
Pitch Perfect 2,"This was one of the only real flaws though. Most of the jokes landed very well, the singing performances were very entertaining and the choice of songs throughout was spot-on and really got the audience into a jovial mood. There's also a charm about these movies that can be rare to come across these days. I really like this series and eagerly look forward to the third installment."
Pitch Perfect 2,"Pitch Perfect 2 is just as much fun as the first one. Kudos to Elizabeth Banks for her first directing role. This time our favourite Capella band are performing in front of the president and his wife. A wardrobe malfunction see's them banned from competing in the US there only hope a competition taking place in Copenhagen, Denmark."
Pitch Perfect 2,"What can I say about this film? I thought it was just as much fun as the original, the story plays out at just the right pace, all our favourite characters return for another outing, including Elizabeth Banks herself as the TV Presenter Gail."
Pitch Perfect 2,If you liked the first film you will like this one also.
Pitch Perfect 2,"The original ""Pitch Perfect"" was, by any definition, a surprise hit; I think it's fair to claim nobody expected a film about a group of female a capella singers to be a box office smash that left a cultural footprint on the new generation of teenage girls. It combined the wry relatability of a film like ""Mean Girls"" and etched in pop/music-influenced energy to create something that was decidedly unique and realized and wound up creating its own eclectic fanbase. On the contrary, I don't think anybody expected there not to be a sequel to the film, and for that film to try and mimic what made the first film so loved."
Pitch Perfect 2,"Aside from a few stumbling attempts to keep up with its own absurdity, and some seriously questionable cultural jokes, ""Pitch Perfect 2"" continues to exploit its own harmony and run with it to notable success. This time around, we are reacquainted with the Bellas, the renowned, award-winning a capella group led by Becca (Anna Kendrick) and Chloe (Brittany Snow). Following an incident involving the klutzy Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) and an unforeseeable wardrobe malfunction in front of President Barack Obama and the First Lady, the Bellas are suspended from competing in any competition. In order to regain their domestic status, the group tries to perform on the international circuit, which has never seen an American a capella group compete in history."
Pitch Perfect 2,"A few years ago, this would've been little sweat for the barrage of talented ladies. However, most of the Bellas are graduating this year, quietly forgetting what has kept them together for so long. Moreover, the only one who appears worried about her future is Becca, who has been skipping out on many rehearsals and practices to advance her lowly status at a record company. She dreams of being a music producer, but has to work around her hard-headed (but hilarious) boss (Keegan-Michael Key), leaving the Bellas without a great deal of organization in the meantime. The group also welcomes a new face named Emily (Hailee Steinfeld), who is known for her ""legacy"" status thanks to her extremely talented mother, who was a Bella during her days at Barden University. This massive competitive undertaking mixed with a serious group identity crisis leaves the Bellas without a lot of options in terms of getting their name back on top."
Pitch Perfect 2,"Before we can appreciate what ""Pitch Perfect 2"" does fairly well, we have to recognize a couple of glaring issues that few seem to be talking about, one of which is the obvious cultural and racial insensitivity on display. There is a Guatemalan character in the film known as Flo (Chrissie Fit), who is a character that is thrown in the Bellas to do nothing other than confirm the common prejudices and stereotypes of Hispanic/South American individuals. Every time she speaks, she attributes some sort of stereotype to her own life, whether it be being kidnapped or having to change her identity and flee the country. The jokes are abrupt tonal shifts from what is otherwise light-hearted fun. In addition, even the blatantly sexist John (John Michael Higgins), one-half of the two announcers in the film who cover the a cappella competitions, has transcended from being simple and effective comic relief to thoroughly mean-spirited and misogynistic. I speak not as an offended viewer, but more as one questioning why many are so quick to just brush off casual racism in comedies when they condemn the same actions in real life (the same question I had when I saw ""Get Hard"")."
Pitch Perfect 2,"""Pitch Perfect 2"" is damn lucky to have an exceptional team of cinematographers, sound editors, sound mixers, costume designers, set decorators, and choreographers to assure that questionable humor and mean-spiritedness don't overtake the project's inherent charm. Despite all the distractions, one can't deny the theatrical power of both this film and its sequel. The glitz, glamor, and beautiful decor of the sets and stages are a feast for the eyes, and never does the a capella aspect get lost in the shuffle. These films are both incomparable collections of talent that simultaneously don't feel like any kind of marketing campaign for a capella organizations, which is a tricky dance to pull off in many cases."
Pitch Perfect 2,"The only other time ""Pitch Perfect 2"" sidesteps is when its coolness gets the best of it. Both films have consistently tried to be hip with the characters' lingo, mannerisms, and actions, and, most of the time, they because of how the talented actresses handle it, but it's silly scenes like Fat Amy ""rubbing her confidence (aka sweat)"" on Becca that work to derail such added charm. These kinds of scenes work paradoxically to the film, which tries to be more adult and less Disney (it comes with a PG-13 rating that should strongly be noted by parents of kids eleven and younger) most of the time, but can't help but throw in some element of childishness in the mix."
Pitch Perfect 2,"Nonetheless, first-time feature-film director Elizabeth Banks (who shows up alongside Higgins once again in the film) takes a lofty challenge with ""Pitch Perfect 2"" and succeeds in making it a visual spectacle and something of an emotional one to boot. By the end, we realize how much time we've spent with these characters, even if it doesn't seem like that much, and we recognize their talents and their personalities, and find ourselves falling in love with their attitudes, their singing, and their talent all over again. That's the beauty of these films, through the occasional bouts of nonsense and ridiculous jokes; these are characters with a great deal of personality encapsulated in a film that has enough of its own to effectively capture it."
Pitch Perfect 2,Pitch perfect 2 is a hilarious comedy and musical movie with lovely women.amazing music and fantastic acting.
Pitch Perfect 2,"It's been three years since the Barden Bellas (Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson) became the first all-female group to win a national title. All seems well until a botched Lincoln Center performance for the president leads to a scandal that strips them of their performing duties, causing internal tension and strife. With the world championships on the horizon in Copenhagen, Denmark, the women must get their act together for their one and only shot at redemption."
Pitch Perfect 2,Lesbians and feminists must see this excellent movie.
Pitch Perfect 2,"After PITCH PERFECT became a box office and critical success, a sequel was announced for a May 15, 2015 release and so now, I review the sequel PITCH PERFECT 2."
Pitch Perfect 2,"The story sees the Barden Bellas being suspended from performing and a new team taking their place. However, they are able to perform again if they win a new Acapella contest, in which, no American team has ever won because the team that they are performing against hates America."
Pitch Perfect 2,I love the story to this film. Such a great concept and well-written and it is well directed by Elizabeth Banks and she is amazing and does a cool and fantastic job at taking a film like this and making it better than the original Pitch Perfect film.
Pitch Perfect 2,The acting is once again amazing and I think the actresses and actors did a good job with their characters once again. Anna Kendrick once again plays the role of Beca and she does a great job. Rebel Wilson plays Fat Amy / Patricia and she is funny now as she was in the first Pitch Perfect.
Pitch Perfect 2,"The rest of the supporting cats including Skylar Astin, Anna Camp, John Michael Higgins, Brittany Snow and Elizabeth Banks, who also directed this, are also amazing and fantastic in their perfect and it is just incredible."
Pitch Perfect 2,The songs are catchy as they were in the previous film and I actually read on-line that they were going to do a third Pitch Perfect movie and I can't wait to see where the Pitch Perfect films go next.
Pitch Perfect 2,"So, overall, PITCH PERFECT 2 is good as the first one. Universal Studios and the entire cast and crew of PP1 and PP2 did a great job with bringing something fresh to this movie and that is one heck of an achievement."
Pitch Perfect 2,10/10.
Pitch Perfect 2,Pitch Perfect 2 was a pure perfection that will entertain you til the end of the film. I rate it 10/10 for its funny humour and jokes. I laugh at the jokes and didn't find it boring. It has full of life and it gives a new texture to a musical film. Like High School Musical meets Step Up movie. The mix of music and conversation was just equal and there are no dead scenes at all. They blow us away with their opening performance and the final performance exceed to the top.
Pitch Perfect 2,"I enjoy this than the first one. It's funnier and the flow of the story is not only focus on Becca but also to the whole group. Rebel Wilson was the saviour of the movie. She acts as the clown and portrays her funny awkward character well. I enjoyed her with the new girl Flo, who will make you laugh with their punch lines."
Pitch Perfect 2,"Pitch Perfect 2, strikes as a mere encore of a sold out performance. The effort is focused on reprising its previous success, rather than delivering something new, fresh, and original. Such retread tends to bore audience, but it works out well in favor of this film."
Pitch Perfect 2,"The story picks up three years after the events in the first installment. Bellas have already won three national titles, and now they're singing with the American president in the audience. This should should propel the group toward a bigger success, only it never happens. Because in the end, when a major wardrobe malfunction involving Fat Amy suddenly cleaves into the occasion, their career meets an abrupt shut off. Gravely humiliated, their only shot at redemption, rests on winning the world championships. This pits them against the brutally talented and ruthlessly mean German Group, Das Sound Machine. This load is more than enough for them to bear, but to make it even worse, Beca (Kendrick) is pulled away from the group by competing priorities, most striking is when an internship for a record label comes into view."
Pitch Perfect 2,"The sequel's efforts to make everything simple is evident as it fixes its spotlight on the same spots that made the first film both fun and moving. Pitch Perfect 2 is both mean and sweet as the first outing, and here, both attributes again are well-mixed and given with equal level of importance. From time to time, it throws double-meaning jokes, which may be mostly offensive, but it also places the emotional weight of the narrative on the other side of the bar, to keep the balance, and to make everything with brow-arching tendency, tolerable. The script is also smart to allow key characters to shine. Most notably, the sequel sheds more light on the franchise's probably goofiest character, Fat Amy, allowing her deliver a big part of the comic efforts of the movie. Strong supports like the mean commentators, Gail and John, can't be dismissed too, and those in German group, with their often display of ruthlessness and authority, that would rather send you to laughing, than shrugging. Where it's most emotional, Beca (Kendrick), is at its center. Anna Kendrick's character keeps the group altogether, and while she is torn between rival commitments and her personal issues, she once again manages to keep Bellas' morale intact. This doesn't make the movie more emotionally complex than it should be, but it's also good to get bits of drama and inspiration, when all you feel is exploding to endless laughter and brittle chuckles."
Pitch Perfect 2,"At some points, there is a sense of wanting for everything to be stronger. There are efforts to tell more with expositions that come into view here and there, but I'll be honest to tell that seldom do these subplots feel necessary, or properly presented. In the end, what makes this sequel equally a stand out, is a convincing power of women empowerment. Amidst of all its efforts to entertain and ignite bursts of laughter, there's a message here, and it imparts a thing or two about equality."
Pitch Perfect 2,"There's still a lot to negatively comment about PITCH PERFECT 2, I mean I get it, we all get it. Nothing is perfect, and certainly, this sequel is without flaw. PITCH PERFECT 2 may be singing the same tunes, but what is not to like in a song that puts you in an LSS mode? What sense does babbling about its shortcoming make, when we'll all end up humming the same songs they've sung in the movie, anyway?"
Pitch Perfect 2,"The first Pitch Perfect came out of left field and bowled most of us over. It is one of the best and most fun comedy musicals ever and a modern day classic already in my opinion. Did it need a sequel? Absolutely not. But Hollywood can't ever say no to more potential money so a sequel was green lit. I was cautiously optimistic because as much as it didn't need a sequel, I wanted to have fun with the Bellas again and wanted it to be good! Pitch Perfect 2 isn't as good as the first one...there is no way around that...but it is a worthy sequel, a ton of fun, makes sense, good characters, new songs, new ideas and its well worth your time especially if you're a fan of the first one. You know what to expect because they were smart not to change the formula of the film. Pitch Perfect is what is has always been and that's a good thing. There aren't a lot of changes or surprises but if something ain't broke, don't fix it! There are plenty of laughs and ridiculous antics and they do sort of play on some of the same jokes but that is to be expected. A lot of negative reviews mention the crass ""racist"" and ""homophobic"" jokes and as always people are too sensitive but I get where they're coming from. The Hispanic character is almost too much to bear."
Pitch Perfect 2,"Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson and Brittany Snow return to lead the Bellas to the World Championships. The three of them are very good, Snow and Kendrick have great chemistry but its a little less obvious as it was in the first film because presumably the characters are already established. Wilson being Wilson there is always the danger of her being overused but both the first film and now this one, she is used just the right amount and very funny in a crass sort of way. Skylar Astin and Adam Devine also return in smaller roles this time around but they are meant to be supporting characters as are Alexis Knapp, Hana Mae Lee and Ester Dean who are way in the background this time around. That's a wise choice though since they're funny schtick was really done in the first film. Anna Camp returns in a small but very good cameo. Ben Platt gets a slightly bigger role (and technically the romantic lead) than in the first film and he's very good and adorable in his role. The newcomer everyone is talking about is Hailee Steinfeld who I adore. I knew she would be an It-Girl from the first time she graced our screens in True Grit. This girl is a fantastic actress and a great singer as it turns out. She is a welcomed addition to the cast, has good chemistry with Kendrick and could lead the film series going forward. The romance with Platt is adorable and while they don't focus on it as much as they did in the first film with Kendrick and Astin it is still very good."
Pitch Perfect 2,"It is very easy to decide whether you will like this film. If you enjoyed the first one, this is more of the same in all the right ways. Elizabeth Banks gives her directorial debut with this film and she shows some talent for sure but the ground work had already been laid. I'm impressed that screenwriter Kay Cannon isn't someone who has been around in film for ages but clearly knows comedy and knows what works. Pitch Perfect 2 is fun!! It is a worthy sequel that builds on its characters but mostly just continues the story from the first. A perfect date night movie that anyone can enjoy. 8/10"
Pitch Perfect 2,"Have you seen pitch perfect? who didn't? it's one of the most popular comedy movies in 2012. Did you like it? Well if you didn't, I advise you not to carry on reading this review because you probably won't also like the sequel."
Pitch Perfect 2,Pitch Perfect 2:
Pitch Perfect 2,"The Video: Thanks to its experienced director Elizabeth Banks, the video shines brightly. Even though it's a comedy, its really special: the parties, the performances and almost everything in this movie is captured to comfort your eyes and to prevent the audience from falling asleep. Basically, an eye candy."
Pitch Perfect 2,"The Soundtrack: The best thing about this movie is the non-stop flawless music. Das Sound Machine really rocked the movie and made it challenging for the Barden Bellas to win. Famous songs and a great track-list, thats all i can say."
Pitch Perfect 2,"The Pace: I have recently seen many movies this year that were good but there's always that moment in the movie where you feel bored. Gladly, Pitch Perfect 2 doesn't fall for that mistake and it never slows down, you actually never feel bored in the movie."
Pitch Perfect 2,"The Story: The usual story about the Bellas trying to win their competition. Except that this time, it's bigger, a World Wide Championship! And some side stories about each of the characters and what they're going to do after graduating."
Pitch Perfect 2,"Overall: As a huge fan of the first part, i found it very original to make a good movie about Acapella which is something new and could be a great advance in the music process of this generation,Pitch Perfect 2 doesn't disappoint at all.Everything we liked about the first part is doubled here.It's like they checked what part of the movie the fans liked and added more of it which means MORE SONGS,MORE FAT AMY,MORE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT,MORE CHALLENGES and Definitely MORE LAUGHS!"
Pitch Perfect 2,After reading the review and watching the trailer you probably know what you're getting from this movie. Feeling into it? Then go watch it because you're surely going to like it
Pitch Perfect 2,Final Score: 8/10
Pitch Perfect 2,"Anna Kendrick and the crew are back in this exciting sequel many have been waiting for. Set three years after the first film, the Barden Bellas have become one of the most popular singing groups in their country. However, after an embarrassing incident during a show puts them in a negative spotlight, the girls attempt to regain their fame by competing in an international competition. I was very pleased by this film, it was funny, charming, energetic, and never disappointed me."
Pitch Perfect 2,"I wouldn't say that this film was as good as the first one, but it pretty close. Like the first film, Pitch Perfect 2 brings out the laughter, charm, and heart that everyone enjoyed in the original. Rebel Wilson, who plays Fat Amy, is much funnier in this time around. Almost every one-liner she spits out had me laughing hysterically. The rest of the girls are very funny as well. I was quite intrigued by how Hailee Steinfield was cast as the new girl. I never expected to see her in a comedy. I was also surprised by some of the song they sing here. There were a lot of songs from the late 90s and early 2000s that many kids who grew in the 90s remember from their childhood as well as recent songs. Overall, this film was very satisfying."
Pitch Perfect 2,"If you enjoyed the 2012 original, I will surely enjoyed this film. While its not quite on the level of the first film, it is still worth watching."
Pitch Perfect 2,"The film has new characters which are quite funny and some old ones have being booted out. The movie definitely gives Fat Amy a bigger part than the first and she is fantastic as I expected, she completes the movie. Moving on, there are some stellar cast such as.... Snoop Dogg, awesome! There's also a scene in which I cannot decide if it actually happened, if so. Wow."
Pitch Perfect 2,"The film does have some plot holes that I noticed, I could be wrong but it didn't bother me. Also, Aubrey is barely in it which is upsetting, but I recovered. That's about it for the bad points."
Pitch Perfect 2,"The good points, well where do I start! Fat Amy is perfect throughout and Becca is beautiful too, her character is fantastic and played very well by Kendrick. This movie is very funny, I could say that it is funnier than the first. I do believe that I may prefer Pitch Perfect 2 over 1 now I think about it, but both are phenomenal! I hope you watch it as it deserves a lot of attention! It also has some pretty emotional scenes! Have fun! There is too many good points to mention them all. You may see it for yourself?!"
Pitch Perfect 2,"In a surprise hit, pitch perfect managed to show that music can be rather interesting and hip while adding something new to the singing genre this time around the Bella's face an incident of their own occurs, when a wardrobe malfunction involving fat Amy aliens while giving a performance in front president Obama and Michelle who appear as themselves in the film. As a result of this incident, the Bellas are temporarily suspended from performing and in order to regain their status, the Bella's have to win an international competition against the Europeans which as never been done by an American singing group. The film does have done side stories including becca juggling her responsibilities as a bellaxwhile working as a record intern. Fat Amy gets a larger role in the sequel and her own hilarious exploits including a romance with bumper from the former trembles make Capella group. While the film ending does suggest a passing of a torch moment but leaves it open for a third film."
