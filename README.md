## 1. Project Overview
The project is based on developing a versatile system that combines sentiment analysis and recommendation, with a user-friendly interface. The main objective is to enable users to explore and benefit from a personalized contextual experience. In this context, sentiment analysis aims to evaluate user comments on films, classifying them into categories such as positive, negative, or neutral. This evaluation feeds into a recommendation system that suggests films based on users' sentimental preferences. The user interface provides an intuitive platform to interact with these features.
